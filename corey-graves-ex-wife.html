I’ve put 11 years into supporting a man to accomplish his dream only for him to punch me in the gut! ‘I’ve been through suicide attempts, alcoholism, among so much more with him and stuck by his side. The kicker is finding out that he’s been sleeping with one of my daughters role models all along. @carmellawwe and @wwegraves I hope you guys are happy. I really do!”</p><p>Amy has since deleted the post and her Instagram account. While both Graves and Carmella denied the accusations, Amy later revealed that she and Graves had already been living separately leading up to the divorce.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Moving On:</h3><p>After the divorce, Amy found solace in the arms of another man.

His father was a psychologist who studied narcolepsy and insomnia. He had published multiple articles and even a book. His mother is also a doctor. Cindy is a psychiatrist with her practice.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/17/unknown_69881736_122709585779954_3141805101339117920_n%20(1)-1681727548464.jpg><p><i>>>>Also, learn more about </i><a href=#><i><strong>Lauren Maltby</strong></i></a><i><strong>,</strong> an American psychologist and retired actress.&lt;&lt;&lt;</i></p><p>Hauri has three older half-siblings from his father's first marriage to <strong>Debbie Jo Rea-Hauri</strong>.

And later, Matthew pursued a college education.</p><p>The talented artist attended the <i>University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</i> to get his degree. He graduated with a Bachelor's in Marketing in <i>2017</i>.</p><p>Hauri's parents and siblings are also college graduates.

The song sampled Rick Astley's hit song <i>Never Ginna Give You Up </i>and had permission to do so.</p><p>However, Astley later sued Hauri for hiring another singer to impersonate his voice and accused him of "stealing his voice." by using an indistinguishable impersonation.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in January of 2023, arguing that the license to use the composition is not the same as copying and imitating Astley's voice and image rights.</p><h2>Relationship Status: Is Yung Gravy Dating Addison Rae's Mother?</h2><p>Yung Gravy is <strong>currently single</strong> at the moment. However, he was briefly linked with &nbsp;Addison Rae's mother, <strong>Sheri Easterling</strong>, in 2022 when the pair went out on a red carpet event together as each other's dates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/17/img12165%20(1)-1681728086322.jpg><p>However, later the pair confirmed that while they were flirty with each other, they could not be boyfriend and girlfriend as Hauri has to travel a lot for his work.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=# rel=nofollow>few publications</a> claim they broke up after two months together.

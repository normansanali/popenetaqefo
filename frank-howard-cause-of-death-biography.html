With 37 home runs and 119 RBIs, he led the league in scoring.</p><p>He was promoted to the majors by the Dodgers following his minor league campaign, and in his 29th at-bat, he blasted his first MLB home run.</p><p>In 1960, Howard took over as Los Angeles’ right fielder after Carl Furillo, a former Brooklyn Dodger All-Star. After hitting, he was voted the National League’s Rookie of the Year.268 with 77 RBIs and 23 home homers. He was given the moniker “Hondo” by his teammates, which was derived from a John Wayne movie character.</p><p>In 1962, Howard was among the top five players in the NL in RBIs (119) and slugging (.560), and he batted.296 with 31 home runs.

The San Francisco Giants and Dodgers were tied for first place at the end of the season.</p><p>His output fell off in 1963, totaling just.273 with 28 home runs and 64 RBIs, but the Dodgers still won the pennant. In Game 4 of the World Series, he helped Los Angeles win 2–1 and sweep the New York Yankees with an upper-deck solo home run off Whitey Ford that broke a scoreless tie.</p><p>The Washington Senators received Claude Osteen, John Kennedy, and cash from the Dodgers on December 4, 1964, in exchange for Howard, Phil Ortega, Pete Richert, and Dick Nen.</p><p>With Los Angeles, Howard was a fourth outfielder; with the Senators, he was a regular player. He played 143 games in 1965, his first year in Washington, and batted.289 with 21 home runs.</p><p>Howard finished third in the AL in 1967 with 36 home runs, behind only Carl Yastrzemski and Harmon Killebrew. From May 12 to May 18, 1968, a one-week period, Howard hit 10 home runs in 20 at-bats.</p><p>When Ted Williams took over as Senators manager in 1969, he assisted Howard in becoming a more methodical batter. In the first year, Howard’s walk totals virtually doubled and he struck out 45 fewer batters thanks to his suggestion to hold off on hitting the first fastball he saw and work pitchers further in the count.</p><p>In 1972, the Senators relocated to Dallas/Fort Worth and changed their name to Texas Rangers. After hitting the team’s first home run in August, Howard batted just.244 with nine home runs in 95 games before his contract was traded for the $20,000 waiver fee to the Detroit Tigers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/03090520/00howard_frank-qmfj-articleLarge.webp?resize=600%2C793&ssl=1"><p>With Detroit, the division winner, he had just one home run in 33 games and was left off of their postseason squad. In 1973, Howard hit.256 while serving as the Tigers’ designated hitter, contributing 29 RBIs and 12 home runs. After the season, Howard was released by the Tigers.</p><p>In 1974, unable to secure a position in the main leagues, Howard committed to play for the Taiheiyo Club Lions in the Pacific League of Japan.

Since its debut on September 13, 1990, through the end of its 20th season on May 24, 2010, NBC’s&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;captivated viewers with its original mix of crime and courtroom drama, inspiring several spin-offs and worldwide adaptations.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>So, fans were overjoyed when&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC confirmed the show’s return</a>&nbsp;for a 21st season on September 28, 2021, following an 11-year absence. Despite the over-a-decade hiatus,&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;was a success, with the next season slated to premiere in 2024.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>The original&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law & Order&nbsp;series</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">created by Dick Wolf</a>, set the tone with its innovative two-part structure. Each episode is split between the investigation of a crime, usually led by a pair of detectives, and the prosecution of the suspect(s) by the district attorney’s office.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>This structure offers viewers two distinct narratives to follow and provides an insightful glimpse into both sides of the criminal justice system. The&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;universe expanded with spin-offs like&nbsp;Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (SVU)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Law & Order: Criminal Intent, each bringing a unique twist to the original format.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>SVU, for example, focuses on sex-based offenses, introducing a more emotional narrative layer, while&nbsp;Criminal Intent&nbsp;offers a psychological perspective by delving into the minds of the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Given the proliferation of Law & Order offshoots, here’s a look at the entire franchise as we rank the many series from best to worst.</p><h2 id=h-1-law-order-special-victims-unit-1999-present data-injectable=false>1.

Season one of the show debuted on September 20, 1999, and in September 2019, its 21st season premiered, making it the longest-running primetime U.S. live-action series in television history.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Meloni played Detective Elliot Stabler</a>&nbsp;until his departure in 2011 to&nbsp;Law & Order: Organized Crime&nbsp;after 12 seasons on the show, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariska Hargitay</a>&nbsp;plays Detective (later promoted to Captain) Olivia Benson, who had been Stabler’s partner.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Some episodes of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a>&nbsp;are based on crimes that have attracted public attention, much like the original&nbsp;Law & Order.

Law & Order&nbsp;(1990 – 2010 & 2022 – Present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-72.png><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Even after an 11-year hiatus that felt like an extended commercial break for the die-hard fans, the original&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;is still going strong, much to the delight of viewers who like their legal cases served with a side of gritty New York street sleuthing. The show, which captivated audiences from 1990 until 2010, had a successful comeback in 2022, and it hasn’t stopped since.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Law & Order provides its viewers with an exhaustive look at the American judicial system. Each episode consists of the crime scene and the courtroom proceedings. Jeffrey Donovan as Detective Frank Cosgrove, Mehcad Brooks as Detective Jalen Shaw, and Hugh Dancy as Lawyer Nolan Pierce currently play the detectives who unravel the mystery.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>As for accuracy,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">longtime cast member Sam Waterston</a>&nbsp;can attest to the show’s authenticity.

A lot of lawyers write for it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Season 23, which will premiere sometime in 2024, further proves the show’s staying power.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3.

Mixing old favorites with fresh blood adds much flavor to this crime-fighting party.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>The show is about more than just catching criminals. It explores the complex and often ambiguous world of organized crime, from the highest levels of the mafia to the lowest members of the underworld. The show, which will return for a fourth season in 2024, promises more thrills and shocks and will keep fans on the edge of their seats.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Law & Order: UK&nbsp;(2009 – 2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-74.png><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>The ITV drama series&nbsp;Law & Order: UK, which ran from 2009 to 2014, was the first British adaptation of an American crime drama. Law & Order: UK demonstrated that the British could successfully adapt an American show by adding their own brand of wit and charm. The show followed the tried and true Law & Order format but added some distinctively British touches. There were wigs in the courtroom, adding some tradition and giving proceedings an air of solemnity.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>The legal portion of the show features verbal sparring between prosecutors and defense attorneys with sharper jibes and more nuanced terminology. Regardless, justice is served with the same ferocity as always. For those who enjoy British drama and are fans of the&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;series,&nbsp;Law & Order: UK&nbsp;hit all the right notes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>In addition, the show was well-received and lauded by critics for its accurate rendition of the original U.S.&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;and its portrayal of the original characters and plots in a British environment.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Law & Order: Criminal Intent&nbsp;(2001 – 2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-75.png><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Wolf’s third installment in his famous Law & Order franchise, set in New York City, portrays a fictitious version of the New York City Police Department. Criminal Intent follows the investigations of the major case squad at One Police Plaza in New York City. Like the original series, many episodes are based on or heavily inspired by real-life crimes.</p><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>The most fiery and intense of the franchise,&nbsp;Criminal Intent&nbsp;follows detective Robert Goren, played with quirky intensity by Vincent D’Onofrio. The show allows viewers more time inside his warped mind and the heads of the criminals he pursues. The series isn’t the run-of-the-mill&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;scenario in which the police investigate a murder, identify the perpetrator, and bring them to justice. Instead, it’s more like “find a body, dissect the killer’s psyche, play a mental game of cat and mouse, then bring him to justice.”</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>For viewers who had grown tired of the no-nonsense, facts-only style of the original&nbsp;Law & Order,&nbsp;Criminal Intent&nbsp;was the perfect remedy. It’s a whirlwind voyage into the criminal and detective’s subconscious. The 10 seasons of&nbsp;Law & Order: Criminal Intent, totaling 195 episodes, aired between September 30, 2001, and June 26, 2011.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Law & Order: True Crime&nbsp;(2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-76.png><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Law & Order: True Crime&nbsp;adopted the successful&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;formula and added real-life crimes intending to create gripping television. The first season of the René Balcer-created NBC drama, which began on September 26, 2017, featured eight episodes and dramatized the trial of Lyle and Erik Menéndez, notoriously convicted in 1996 for the deaths of their parents, José and Kitty Menéndez.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Several&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb&nbsp;</a>users gave the series high marks for its excellent acting and dedication to accuracy, and they also praised the show for its accurate portrayal of the events. Moreover, some critics thought it had a lot of potential and praised Edie Falco’s performance. However, even though Falco had a stellar performance as defense attorney Leslie Abramson, the show needed more to win over either the public or the critics.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Some viewers complained about the show’s alleged partiality and factual errors. At the same time, other fans felt the series presented the abuse claims by the Menendez brothers as reality and showed the brothers in a too-sympathetic light. In the end, True Crime‘s serialized narrative resulted in a show that felt more like a&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;imposter than an actual part of the franchise, and the show has been on hiatus since May 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Law & Order: Los Angeles&nbsp;(2010 – 2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Law-and-Order-LA.jpg><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>With the original&nbsp;Law & Order‘s 20-year run ending the previous spring,&nbsp;Law & Order: Los Angeles&nbsp;filled the void. And, in an audacious attempt to bring some California sunshine, a change from the dark and rainy streets of the original series,&nbsp;Law & Order: LA&nbsp;boldly transported viewers to the land of eternal summer, celebrity scandals, and the most exciting car chases.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>The concept was straightforward: add beach sand and palm trees to the tried-and-true&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;formula, and&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;would be a hit. However, the revolving door of the main characters and scheduling changes took a lot of work to keep up with. The show’s tone was another issue. The drama and realism of Law & Order have long been its hallmarks. But&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;seemed more concerned with creating a tale of Hollywood excess than a riveting crime drama.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Skeet Ulrich, Terrence Howard, and Alfred Molina were just some of the big names attached to the series. Yet, none could stop the show from prematurely packing up its surfboard. Ultimately, on May 13, 2011, after only one season,&nbsp;Law & Order: Los Angeles&nbsp;was canceled, revealing that not even the glamour of Hollywood could save this offshoot.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Law & Order: Trial by Jury&nbsp;(2005 – 2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-77.png><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Law & Order: Trial by Jury, set in New York City, had a lot to live up to, given that Dick Wolf, the man who could do no wrong in the eyes of network executives, was its creator. After all, this was the fourth installment in a franchise that was very consistent in its format. It was clear what to expect from each episode of&nbsp;Law & Order: a gruesome crime, a thorough investigation, a fair trial, and a gratifying conclusion.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>However,&nbsp;Trial by Jury&nbsp;switched things up a little. The jury selection process, jury deliberations, and defense use of psychological studies and socioeconomic status profiling in mock trials are all aspects of criminal law rarely shown in other&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;series but get their due attention in&nbsp;Trial by Jury. First announced on September 28, 2004, the series kicked off on March 3, 2005, and ran until January 21, 2006.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Trial by Jury&nbsp;boasted a talented ensemble cast, including names like Bebe Neuwirth, Amy Carlson, and Kirk Acevedo. Their best efforts, however, were not enough to prevent&nbsp;Trial by Jury&nbsp;from becoming the first&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;spin-off to fail spectacularly shortly after its debut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSrsGakkax6orrDZqarnJWnerSx0aKcrGWilrusscNmmZ6rpGLBsHnWqKmsrF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-law-and-order-series-ranked-best-to-worst.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harper-grace-burtka-harris.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harper-grace-burtka-harris.html>Harper Grace Burtka-Harris- Who Is Neil Patrick Harris Daughter?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./erin-thumann.html>Erin Thumann - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./erin-thumann.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

But this seemed like a bad decision, as the duo was already struggling to make their relationship work and the stress of being restaurateurs was getting to them.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this James Martin Bio to learn all about him.</span></p><h3><b>James Martin On Food Network’s Me Or The Menu</b></h3><p><span>Food Network’s </span><i><span>Me or the Menu</span></i><span> premiered on June 30, 2022, and it tested the couples, throwing them headfirst into the world of owning and running a restaurant. Well, making marriage work is indeed hard, but put the stress of being restaurateurs on top of that, and you’re walking on thin ice. Just as the trailer questioned the show’s journey for these couples “The perfect pairing or a recipe for disaster?”</span></p><p><span>All excited for the world to see him on the show, James took it to his IG on the premiere day to write, “#MeOrTheMenu Premieres June 30 at 10|9c June 30 at 10 @foodnetwork @discoveryplus @firstnamejessica”</span></p><p><span>Joining James and Jessica for the inaugural season of </span><i><span>Me or the Menu</span></i><span> were their co-stars — Kathleen and Nate (owners of an Italian cuisine food truck), Nicole and Alan (owners of </span><i><span>Greenios</span></i><span>, a vegan burger restaurant), and Jeanette and Randi (owner of </span><i><span>Leland</span></i><span>).</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Unlike his wife, James isn’t new to the TV.

So, Jessica felt pressured to be the sole breadwinner working two jobs. Moreover, despite being overworked, Jessica also refused to relinquish control of her responsibilities at the restaurant to pay extra money for help. And this wasn’t sitting well with James.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, these restaurateurs got married on August 30, 2014, eight months after their engagement.

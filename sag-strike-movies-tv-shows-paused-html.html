The movie was supposed to be released on June 28, 2024. <a href=#>Variety</a> later reported that the film would be delayed to May 23, 2025.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk2y74zs002h3d699mkv3sfh@published>Beetlejuice 2</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk2y7hjk002u3d69mq3tskdh@published data-word-count=98>Per <a href=#>Variety</a>, production was paused on the Tim Burton–directed affair, initially slated for September 6, 2024 (right in time for Halloween).

The now–Emmy nominated queen of darkness and apathy, Jenna Ortega, plays the daughter of Winona Ryder’s character, Lydia Deetz. None other than Mr. Juice himself, Michael Keaton, was also set to step into his iconic striped suit once more, as well as Catherine O’Hara, who will be reprising her role as Delia Deetz. You know, now that the strike is over.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk2xrbr4001n3d692765opjr@published>Gladiator 2</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk2xrv9t001s3d69sxhu9y3k@published data-word-count=48>The news of Gladiator 2 production being halted halfway through filming, <a href=#>according to Deadline</a>, left 20-year-old fans of Normal People and middle age fathers all around the world crestfallen with only <a href=#>Paul Mescal getting buff</a> to comfort them.

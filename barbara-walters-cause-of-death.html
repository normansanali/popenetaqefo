Doubleday expressed interest in turning the article into a book in a letter she received not long after it was published.</p><p>For Walters, it would be beneficial for tongue-tied socially awkward people. <strong>In 1970, she collaborated with June Callwood as a ghostwriter to release the book How to Talk with Practically Anyone about Practically Anything. </strong>The book‚Äôs success came as a shock to Walters. There were already eight printings and hundreds of thousands of copies in circulation around the world by 2008. It had also been translated into at least six different languages. Her autobiography, titled ‚ÄúAudition: A Memoir‚Äù was released in 2008 by Walters.</p><h2><strong>Barbara Walters Personal Life</strong></h2><p><strong>Four times, to three different men, Walters tied the knot.</strong> Her first husband, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant named Robert Henry Katz died in a car accident.

Merv Adelson, CEO of Lorimar Television was her third husband. They tied the knot in 1981 and split up ten years later. They reconciled in 1992 after getting back together after their second divorce in 1986.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Barbara-Walters-Death-2-1.jpg><p>In college, Walters dated Roy Cohn, a lawyer Cohn claimed he proposed to Walters the night before she wed Lee Guber, but Walters always maintained that he never asked her out. She said that she would be loyal to Cohn forever because of how he had helped her adopt her daughter Jacqueline. Walters writes in her autobiography that she is thankful to Cohn for defending her father in court.</p><p>Walters claims that her father had an arrest warrant for failure to appear because he missed a court date in New York while the family was vacationing in Las Vegas, but that Cohn was able to get the charge dropped. In 1986, when Cohn was being tried for disbarment, Walters testified on his behalf as a character witness.

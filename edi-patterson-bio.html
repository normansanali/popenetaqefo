She’s mostly known for her roles in comedy.&nbsp;</p><p>She is most recognized as Fran in the 2019 film Knives Out, Veronica in the 2014 television series Partners, Ms. Abbott in the 2016–2017 television series Vice Principals, and Judy Gemstone in The Righteous Gemstones (2019–present).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Came From A Middle-Class Family</h2><p>Edi’s mother was a teacher, although it is not clear whether it is a high school teacher or otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, her father was a plumber and going as per the income of both, the total revenue for the family would be roughly $120,000 per year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Studied At Texas State University</h2><p>When Edi studied at the institution, it was called Southern Texas University. However, in 2003, the name changed to Texas State University-San Marcos and later known as Texas State University. Edi took up theater as her major at the school and emphasized acting.&nbsp;</p><p>She admits that the university was not famous at the time, unlike now when people flock to study muscle theater, which Edi says ranks among the top in the country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Made Her Television Debut In 2001</h2><p>No matter how much you practice in front of a mirror or on the stage, you will never catch a break unless you move to where the action is.&nbsp;</p><p>Edi’s move to LA paid off in 2001 when she starred in CSI as Rosalyn Dudek. She starred in the episode titled “Too Tough to Die,” thereby making her debut on television.&nbsp;</p><p>Her acting must have impressed producers because she has starred in several other shows since then. Her acting career is active, and till now she is landing roles in current series such as “The Righteous Gemstones,” which premieres on HBO on August 18, 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Is A Member Of Improv Theater</h2><p>Edu was doing plays and acted in independent movies for free in college. After graduating, she realized that what she was doing was not making her any money; hence, she decided to pursue television acting. She, however, did improvisational theater for a while before deciding to change gears, but even today, she still considers it part of her. According to Edi and Dan, her husband, improv is their calling and their lifestyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Edi Patterson Net Worth</h2><p>According to various reliable online sources, Edi, who brought in $3 million and $5 million Networth, earned most of her earnings from her Yeezy sneakers.&nbsp;</p><p>While she had exaggerated over the years about the size of her business, the money she pulled in from her profession was real–enough to rank as one of the biggest celebrity cashouts of all time. Her Basic income source is mostly from being a successful Actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Was A Guest Writer On Snl For Two Weeks</h2><p>Edi now believes that she can write a movie or plot within a few days after having the experience of being a guest writer at Saturday Night Live (SNL) for two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, therefore, no surprise that she was not only a cast member but also a writer of “The Underground,” a Showtime sketch series created by Damon Wayans.&nbsp;</p><p>Edi, alongside Michael Che, a stand-up comedian, signed short contracts to be guest writers for the two episodes that aired on March 2 and March 9, 2013. The experience was an eye-opener for Edi, and she learned a lot about the production side of television entertainment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Married Daniel J. O’Connor&nbsp;</h2><p>Usually, people in the same line of work will end up together because their paths will cross, and they might end up spending lots of time together.&nbsp;</p><p>Edi and her husband Daniel J. O’Connor met at the Hideout Theater where Edi took some classes while Dan had gone to teach a workshop. On May 9, 2003, the two exchanged vows and have escaped the infidelity scandals that celebrity couples seem to have. Dan is an accomplished producer whose films include Kung Fu Panda 2 and Madagascar 2.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Does Not Have Children</h2><p>People say children are the culmination of any marriage and that any couple looks forward to having a family.&nbsp;</p><p>However, partners have different marriage goals, and for Edi and her husband, raising children has not been one of them. For over 15 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Edi has been married, and by now, they would have had children, whether their own or adopted. However, they have chosen to live independently, and there is no talk of them having children any time soon.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw6JkqZmkqbKzv86nZJuhn2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fedi-patterson-bio.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-kai-johnson-gang-member-arrested-for-killing-brothers-in-bronx.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-kai-johnson-gang-member-arrested-for-killing-brothers-in-bronx.html>Who Is Kai Johnson?

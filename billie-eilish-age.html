It reached the top 15 of the record charts in a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and was a commercial success.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Tim Roth Children: Meet Jack Roth, Timothy Hunter Roth, Cormac Roth</a></h4><p>Eilish lived in Los Angeles’ Highland Park neighborhood with her parents before moving out in 2019. She claimed in 2021 that she still spends a significant amount of time in the bedroom she shared with her parents. She claimed to suffer from synesthesia, Tourette syndrome, and depression.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Billie Eilish Age: How Old Is Billie Eilish</h2><p>Due to the name that Billie Eilish has made in the world of music, you are tempted to think that she is very old, however, she is not. The renowned musician who has won quite a number of awards was born on December 18, 2001, so she will be 21 years old this year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Billie Eilish biography</h2><p>Billie Eilish, one of the biggest stars in the United States, was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001. She is the offspring of Eilish’s touring musicians Patrick O’Connell and Maggie Baird, an actress and teacher.</p><p>Eilish is of Irish and Scottish ancestry and was created through in vitro fertilization.</p><p>Her middle name, Pirate, was supposed to be her first name, and her middle name, Eilish. She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.</p><p>At the age of eight, Eilish joined the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus and made appearances on talent shows.</p><p>She started learning how to play the ukulele when she was six years old. When she was 11 years old, she composed her first “real” song for her mother’s songwriting class. She drew inspiration for the song, which is about a zombie apocalypse, from The Walking Dead and used script lines and episode titles in its composition.</p><p>Contrary to her dislike of acting auditions, Eilish enjoyed recording the background dialogue for crowd scenes in the movies Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series.</p><p>Eilish, then 13 years old, and Finneas, who had his own band and had been writing and producing music for some time, started co-writing songs in 2015. “She’s Broken” and “Fingers Crossed,” the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish, were the first songs they recorded together. She recalled, “We recorded them and released them on SoundCloud just for fun.</p><p>The song “Ocean Eyes” by Eilish was made available on November 18, 2015. The song was originally intended for Finneas’ band, the Slightlys, but he changed his mind when he realized Eilish’s vocals would fit the song’s lyrics better. Finneas wrote, mixed, and produced the song. He was taken aback when Eilish’s dance teacher at Revolution Dance Center asked them to compose a song for choreography.</p><p>In order to package Eilish before she signed with a major label in January 2016, Finneas and his manager worked with Apple Music to sign her to A&R company Platoon.</p><p>Then Eilish hired a publicist and a stylist, who together helped shape her image and introduced her to Chanel, a high-end fashion brand. Megan Thompson’s “Ocean Eyes” music video made its debut on Eilish’s official YouTube channel on March 24, 2016.</p><p>Many media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors like Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, Beats 1, KCRW, and Chris Douridas, praised and promoted the song “Ocean Eyes” and Eilish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpugpaSZmnqmtcuiqqFlkZyycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbillie-eilish-age.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brent-barry-ex-wife-erin-barry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brent-barry-ex-wife-erin-barry.html>Brent Barrys Ex-Wife Erin Barry What Could Be The Reason Behind The Ex-Pairs Divorce?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./my-apocalypse-lyrics-html.html>Escape The Fate My Apocalypse lyr</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./my-apocalypse-lyrics-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

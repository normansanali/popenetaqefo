In 1968, Danny Kirwan became the group's third artist.</p><p>In 1970, Christine McVie joined Fleetwood Mac as a keyboardist and vocalist. And in 1974, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band.</p><p>After multiple members left and joined the group, the lineup, who wrote and performed on their number one—and potentially most well-known—album Rumours consisted of <a href=#>Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, and John McVie—the core five.</a></p><p>But, when looking back on the band's stardom, Nicks' is considered the most successful, so why did Christine McVie's star not rise in the same way?</p><h2></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-mcvie-39-s-contribution-to-fleetwood-mac>Christine McVie's Contribution To Fleetwood Mac</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/christine-mcvie-playing-piano.jpg><p>When asked how McVie's "contribution stacks up against her bandmates," Katz said: "As far as songwriting, you look at it as a three-legged stool. When you take one of those legs away, the whole thing collapses."</p><p>He continued, "'Collapse' is too strong a word in the case of Fleetwood Mac, as they were all talented. But I think the magic of Fleetwood Mac was that you had Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, and Christine McVie, three strong songwriters, three strong personalities, who were very different and yet complementary. A big part of their appeal was that you've got three great songwriters for the price of one when you bought a Fleetwood Mac record."</p><p>Katz believes having three strong songwriters in one band "trimmed down the fat."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saying, "With Fleetwood Mac, if you've got four songs each from three great songwriters, you got their four best songs, and it really trimmed down the fat. I think that was what made them such a powerful group."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Christine McVie's Horrific Divorce From Fleetwood Mac's Bassist Resulted In The Band's Most Profitable And Best Songs</a></span></p><p>"In the old days, if you bought an album by one person, there were like 12 songs on it, and maybe four or five of them are great, and the other ones are good but not quite as exciting," Katz said.</p><p>Millions of people surely felt McVie's contribution to music, and Katz can't limit her legacy to just one thing. He said, "I hate to limit an artist by just saying it's all about one particular song. To me, that group of those five people, when they had their outsized success, it was this kind of magical combination of personalities that came together and produced this group."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks>Why Christine McVie Got Less Attention Than Stevie Nicks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fleetwood-Mac-1978.jpg><p>Music Journalist Larry Katz revealed why Christine McVie is believed to have gotten less attention than Nicks'. A 1987 interview by Katz was digitized in 2022 at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Northeastern University as part of a larger collection of interviews known as the "Katz Tapes."</a></p><p>When Katz interviewed McVie, Fleetwood Mac had just released their album Tango in the Night, which featured the hit single "Little Lies," co-written by McVie and her then-husband, Eddy Quintela.</p><p>Northeastern interviewed Katz about his time speaking with McVie, and they asked him why he thought McVie got less attention than Nicks. Katz said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Stevie Nicks had by far the bigger solo career; Stevie Nicks became a solo star on her own. [Recently] she said the initial single she made with Tom Petty was what kind of propelled her solo career, and she suddenly had this existence apart from Fleetwood Mac."</p><p>He continued, "That was never the case with Christine McVie, who did release a few solo albums. And I think she probably toured solo. So that was one obvious thing, that she didn't have these huge pop hits on her own."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Christine McVie Regret Her 16-Year Hiatus From Fleetwood Mac?</a></span></p><p>Katz also believes it has to do with the two women's personalities and public personas: "But I also think it had to do with her personality, that she was just a quieter, more low-key person. If you saw Fleetwood Mac in concert, Stevie Nicks was dressed in her scarves and floated; she didn't play an instrument, so she was kind of floating around the stage and dancing, whereas Christine was trapped behind the keyboard off to the side."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, it wasn't like she got up and danced around or anything like that," Katz said. "I think it was just her personality, too, that she was more comfortable in that role. But as the obituaries pointed out, she was responsible for quite a lot of the band's popular songs."</p><h2 id=remembering-christine-mcvie-who-passed-away-at-79>Remembering Christine McVie Who Passed Away At 79</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49239957.jpg><p>In November 2022, Christine McVie sadly passed away at 79 after suffering a "short illness."</p><p>Katz states McVie was fundamental to the group. Saying, "People will listen to Fleetwood Mac's songs and realize just how—not that she was unappreciated—but that she's just an irreplaceable part of that group. One of the first things I thought of is that Fleetwood Mac is unlikely to ever tour again, even though they kept on putting out these patchwork touring units of the group with one or another member missing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "But I think without her now and the fact that Lindsey Buckingham is estranged from the other members, this spells, I believe, the end for Fleetwood Mac as a live group."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Fleetwood Mac Replace The Band Members That Passed Away? "The Line In The Sand Has Been Drawn"</a></span></p><p>With the loss of McVie, <a href=#>Mick Fleetwood says there's no chance of a reunion for the iconic group.</a></p><p>"I truly think the line in the sand has been drawn with the loss of Chris," he explained. "I'd say we're done, but then we've all said that before," Fleetwood stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdKtoKedXaKwt7XEZp6orF2hsrS%2FjJqrrZ2eqbawuoytn5qmXajBpsLInmSnoZOgwG7DyK2fZp6cmrK1w86om2alkZh8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-christine-mcvie-got-less-attention-than-stevie-nicks-with-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nicholas-miuccio-net-worth-173324.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nicholas-miuccio-net-worth-173324.html>Nicholas Miuccio Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kevin-powell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kevin Powell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kevin-powell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

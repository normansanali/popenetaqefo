Plus, you have the option of keeping the body in a alternative container instead of a casket. Cremation is a simpler process that also helps save ground space, but it is not so in case of burial.</span></span><h2>Is the Bible against cremation?</h2>The Bible neither favors nor forbids the process of cremation.

In addition, you have the option of keeping the body in an alternative container instead of a coffin. Cremation is a simpler process that also helps save floor space, unlike in the case of a burial.<h2>Is it better to be buried or burned?</h2>Although cremation is more eco-friendly than burial, cremations burn much natural gas (a temperature of to 750 to 800 degrees must be maintained for 45 to 90 minutes) releasing greenhouse gases and vaporising other chemicals that may be present in the body such as mercury (dental fillings) and dioxins and furans.<h2>Which part of human body does not burn in fire?</h2>Quite often the peripheral bones of the hands and feet will not be burned to such a high intensity as those at the centre of the body, where most fat is located.<h2>Cremation vs Burial: The Pros and Cons You Need to Know to Make an Informed Decision</h2><p></p><h2>Why do we bury the dead instead of cremate?</h2>The most popular belief however is that people buried bodies because dead bodies decay.

Many Christians choose cremation as an alternative to burial, while still retaining those aspects of their traditional funeral practices that allow them to honor the lives of their loved ones and glorify God.<h2>Can you be cremated and still go to heaven?</h2>People who have been cremated can certainly go to Heaven.<h2>What does the Bible say about keeping ashes?</h2>There is no Biblical precedent for cremation. Ultimately, it depends on the personal wishes of the deceased or, if no wishes were left, the feelings and preferences of those making decisions for their final arrangements. If you decide to cremate and scatter ashes, nothing in the Bible prohibits you from doing so.<h2>Can you be reincarnated if you are cremated?</h2>However, if you believe that the souls of the dead will come back to life, then that bone being destroyed in cremation does not influence “spiritual reincarnation.”<h2>Do they drain your blood before cremation?</h2>15. Is a body drained before cremation? Draining a body of fluids does not happen before cremation. If a body is embalmed before cremation, the bodily fluids are exchanged (drained, and then replaced) with chemicals during the embalming process.<h2>Do human ashes smell?</h2>Most people who keep the ashes of a departed human or pet loved one at home say they detect no odor from the cremains. A few respondents indicated a very slight metallic odor or a very slight scent of incense. Your experience of keeping cremains at home may vary, depending on the type of container you choose.<h2>How long does it take to cremate a body?</h2>The process takes anywhere between three to four hours depending on the power of the retort and the mass of the body inserted. After this step is completed, the cremated bones will come out of the retort and then be processed.<h2>What is God's view on cremation?</h2>Since the Bible does not ban nor promote cremation, most Christian denominations do not consider cremation to be sinful. The Catholic church, however, held an opposing view for many years.<h2>Why is being buried better?</h2>Advantages of Burial:<p>Provides a gravesite for family and friends to visit.

During disease outbreaks, they may have feared that bodies could transmit disease. Still, this may be one of the reasons why people thought bodies should be buried 6 feet deep.</p><h2>What religion is cremation more important than burial?</h2>Hinduism<p>One religion that strongly encourages cremation is Hinduism. According to Hindu beliefs, cremation not only helps with the disposal of physical remains but also aides in ushering the soul of the deceased into the hereafter for its reincarnation/rebirth.</p><h2>Why do we bury the dead six feet under?</h2>Medical schools in the early 1800s bought cadavers for anatomical study and dissection, and some people supplied the demand by digging up fresh corpses. Gravesites reaching six feet helped prevent farmers from accidentally plowing up bodies.<h2>Does everyone automatically go to Heaven?</h2>Many people speak as if everyone will make it to heaven. There is a prevailing though that all you have to do is be born, and then die, and you will be admitted to into paradise.

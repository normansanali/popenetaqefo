While she was joined by her children, Lourdes, 26, David Banda, 17, Mercy James, 17, and 10-year-old twins Stella and Estere, it was her oldest son Rocco, 23, that the attention revolved around momentarily, as he was introduced to Madonna's boyfriend, Joshua Popper, for the first time.</p><p>While there were no reports about how the meeting went between the two, according to The Sun, the family celebrated the night away together.

And in true Madonna fashion, the Like A Virgin singer put together an outfit that was both sexy and fashionable, by wearing a black lace bra, corset, and an oversized black silk shirt with matching pants.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madonna Was Spotted Backstage Supporting One Of Her Favourite Artists Following Her Health Scare</a></span></p><p>Madonna and her newest boyfriend first met earlier this year while Joshua was in the boxing ring.

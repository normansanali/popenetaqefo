The track takes place within the Earth’s atmosphere and appears to be located over the eastern parts of North America, as well as some parts of Europe, Africa, and South America.</p><p>There’s no doubt about what the toughest Mario Kart track of all time is, and that is the legendary<strong> Rainbow Road</strong>. It’s the one that even the greatest players can find difficult and while there have been several versions of this course, the Mario Kart Wii version was easily the hardest.</p><p>Mario Kart isn’t exactly known for its difficulty, but these 10 notorious tracks have infuriated more than a few avid players over the years. The Mario Kart franchise is one of the most popular of all time, with the games being both incredible fun for the entire family, yet equally as competitive and difficult.</p><p>This track is annoying and just a huge pain in the bum much of the time. Goddamn, Mario Kart Wii is now even more likely to be the worst Mario Kart series game. And that’s a shame with its wonderful music and courses.</p><p>While desert tracks are often the easiest to drive in Mario Kart, the brand new Bone-Dry Dunes in Mario Kart 8 shatters the stereotype. With ever-changing road surfaces that go from sand and wood to cement and bone in a short distance, it’s very hard to know which type of racing to perform at any given time.</p><p>Next up, we have one of Mario Kart Wii ’s most infamous tracks: Wario’s Gold Mine. While it appears quite early in the game, in the Flower Cup, Nintendo were probably messing with us there. A lot of players just did not know what they were letting themselves in for here.</p><h2>What is the best special cup track in Mario Kart 64?</h2><p><strong>7 Banshee Boardwalk</strong> (Mario Kart 64) There’s no doubt that Mario Kart 64 ’s Banshee Boardwalk is one of the spookiest Special Cup tracks ever. This dimly lit, haunted area boasts a lot of long, narrow straights peppered with very tight turns that are almost impossible to take at speed.</p><p>Mario Kart is famous for its<strong> multiplayer fun,</strong> but, for those who want to take it to the next level, here are the series 10 most difficult tracks. By Chris Littlechild Published May 24, 2020. Share.</p><p>Mario Kart DS ’s Tick-Tock Clock is<strong> inspired by the Tick Tock Clock course in Super Mario 64.</strong> While the concept itself is a little uninspired and the track isn’t nearly as long as some others in this list, there’s just so much packed into it.</p><p>Super Mario Kart ’s Ghost Valley tracks are also characterized by their dark, gloomy, dilapidated bridge vibe, coupled with pitfalls everywhere that are often very difficult to see. Ghost Valley 3, the last of them, definitely earns its place in the game’s challenging Star Cup.</p><p>As Special Cup courses go, we wouldn’t<strong> rank this one any</strong> higher<strong> among the most challenging.</strong></p><p><strong>Neo Bowser City features</strong> in the Star Cup of Mario Kart 7. This time, Mario’s formidable nemesis has branched out a little from the usual Bowser’s Castle tracks. Neo Bowser City is a bit of a mixed bag, which is why we’ve ranked it in the middle of our rundown.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>When was Vanilla Lake in Mario Kart?</h2><p>The first Vanilla Lake track that shows up in<strong> 1992s</strong> Super Mario Kart is extremely difficult. Basically, you skid around on ice for a couple of minutes trying to avoid the snow that drastically slows you down. It’s like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>The main reason why Dragon Driftway is one of the hardest Mario Kart tracks is because<strong> the turns are extremely difficult on 200cc mode.</strong> In fact, sometimes it feels almost impossible.</p><p><strong>Vanilla Lake is definitely one of the hardest tracks in Mario Kart history, and one that I personally</strong> never<strong> fully mastered.</strong></p><p>That being said, it is also<strong> one</strong> of the best Mario Kart tracks. Everything from the design, music, and track obstacles just works. If there’s any tracks that are worth mastering, then<strong> Dragon Driftway is certainly one of them.</strong></p><p>Yet,<strong> Banshee Boardwalk has that special something that makes you want to return to the track.</strong> Be it the spooky atmosphere, the catchy music, or the considerable challenge of winning, this difficult Mario Kart track will always be a favorite for the N64 entry to the franchise.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYra0edOhnGagkaexpr%2FTZqSaqpmkeqyt0a1kraqRmLhuhJJqb2xn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-hardest-mario-kart-track-83183.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./american-idol-scandals-and-controversies-through-the-years.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./american-idol-scandals-and-controversies-through-the-years.html>'American Idol Scandals and Controversies Through the Years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-daredevils-punisher-gets-right-about-vets-html.html>What Daredevils Depiction of the Punisher Gets Right About War Vets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-daredevils-punisher-gets-right-about-vets-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Now, as she prepares to resume her tour, fans have been wondering if he would be in the audience this time as well. Travis didn't hesitate to confirm the news himself.</p><p><strong>"Oh, you know I gotta go support," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said about it</a></strong>. He also expressed his appreciation for how supportive Taylor Swift had been, attending as many of his games as she could, adding that it's important to be involved in each other's careers, as they are both very busy.</p><p><strong>"We are both very career-driven. I think we both love what we do and any chance that I can show my support to her — knowing that she has shown me all the support in the world throughout the season — it’s just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay," he gushed</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis Kelce also spoke about where he was most excited to see her play, with England taking the first place.</p><p>"I’ll tell you what, I think the London shows. I think she’s at Wembley [Stadium] eight times? Which is mind-blowing that she can do that many shows in one stadium and fill that thing up," he said. "And London is always an amazing city and Paris is a beautiful city and she will be all over Europe. <strong>There won’t be a bad show, I promise you that.</strong>"</p><h2 id=travis-39-favorite-eras-tour-shows-so-far>Travis' Favorite Eras Tour Shows So Far</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-1.jpg><p>Travis Kelce, of course, adores attending Taylor Swift shows, and he did so before they even started dating.

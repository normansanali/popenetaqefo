The new cast member is none other than Days of Our Lives alum Molly Burnett, who plays Detective Grace Muncy on SVU.</p><p>Find everything related to Molly Burnett’s bio, including her career, relationships, and partner, in the article below.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Molly Burnett Partner?</strong></h3><p>Although Molly Burnett was one of the many actors who appeared in the online romantic comedy series Relationship Status, her own relationship status seems to be unclear as of October 2022.</p><p>Molly absolutely refrains to share any information about her love life on the Internet. Her Instagram (<a href=#>@mollyburnett</a>) handle is mostly full of posts related to her job and career. That makes it tough for us to know if Molly had any partners in 2022.</p><p>That being said, Molly shared a picture of herself with the Queen of the South actor Hemky Madera and called him her “partner in crime.” However, it seems like there’s nothing going on between too as Hemky is happily in a relationship with his partner, Jesse Lynn Madera.</p><p>While Molly may not talk about her personal life on the Internet, she has talked about dating previously. In an exclusive video interview with Golderby in 2018, she shared that she’s never done the dating app thing. Making a Twitter post on July 23, 2019, Molly wrote, “Sorry, dating PTSD.”</p><h3><strong>Molly Burnett Relationship History</strong></h3><p>Talking about Molly Burnett’s relationship history, she was dating Queen of the South actor Aaron Hill, who has appeared in a plethora of minor roles in shows including Breaking Bad, Gilmore Girls, The Middle, Rizzoli & Isles, and Greek, among others circa 2008.</p><p>However, express.co.uk reported that the duo reported that their relationship only lasted a year as they called it quits in 2009.</p><p>A look at Aaron’s Instagram reveals that he is already married. His wife, Chelsea Hill, is a fitness professional and a BODI instructor. The lovely couple is also the parents of two beautiful human beings, Scarlett and Wyatt.</p><p>After splitting up with Aaron, Molly moved on to a comparatively more public romance as she began dating her onscreen boyfriend from Days of Our Lives Casey Jon Deidrick. Much like her previous relationship, her romance with Casey also lasted one year as they broke up in 2010.</p><p>In 2021, Molly’s former boyfriend Casey Deidrick was dating his longtime girlfriend Jahan Yousaf, whom he began dating in 2013.</p><p>To sum up Molly’s relationship history, Law & Order: SUV actress has only been linked to two men in the past 14 years.</p><h3><strong>Molly Burnett Movies And TV Shows</strong></h3><p>Molly Burnett was known to have a dramatic flair about her from a young age. Her theatrical career began to flourish while she was a student at Littleton High School.</p><p>She took on various roles at both LHS and theatre companies in the greater Denver area. Some of her credits include Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Noises Off, and Annie.</p><p>After graduating with honors from LHS, Molly enrolled at Wagner College. It was there when she decided to pursue her professional acting aspirations in Los Angeles putting a pause on her academic pursuits.</p><p>Within a month of moving to Los Angeles, Molly landed the role of Melanie Layton on the series Days of Our Lives. For her performance as Melanie, she was even nominated for Daytime Emmy in the year 2010 and 2012 in the Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series category.</p><p>In 2012, Molly left Days of Our Lives in order to pursue other roles. Quickly, she landed guest spots on prime-time series such as CSI: NY and Major Crimes.</p><p>In 2015, the SUV actress appeared in the role of Nina Moore on CSI: Cyber. In the year 2018, Molly was again nominated for Daytime Emmy in Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Digital Daytime Drama Series category for the role of Laura in Relationship Status. Molly played the role of Kelly Anne on USA Networks’ hit drama “Queen of the South” from 2017 to 2019.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Molly Burnett Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>While any official data on Molly Burnett’s net worth is not on the Internet, rough calculations may suggest it to be close to $1 million.</p><p>While Molly has had some measure of success in her decade-long career, landing a major role on SVU was her greatest break yet.</p><p>Molly made her first appearance on SVY in the September 29 episode of the show. In the episode, we found out that Molly, who plays Muncy, is a detective for the NYPD who reports to Benson. Viewers also learned that her mother is dead and that she lives with her brother in Queens.</p><h3><strong>Molly Burnett Height</strong></h3><p>Although Molly Burnett’s height is not publicly available, we think she stands at 5 feet 6 inches based on her Instagram pictures.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Molly Burnett?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>According to imdb.com, Molly was born on April 23, 1988, which means she was 34 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Molly Burnett From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>CSI: Cyber actress is originally from Littleton, Colorada, USA.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Are Molly Burnett’s Parents And Siblings?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Molly Burnett is the firstborn child of her parents, Katie and David Burnett.

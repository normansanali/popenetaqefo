But in the words of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fran Drescher's</a> beloved character Fran Fine from the smash hit '90s sitcom The Nanny, "When you look good, you feel good."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are words I've carried with me and lived by ever since I grew up watching the female-led sitcom starring Drescher: a strong, independent, and funny-as-hell Jewish woman who paved the way for others like her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that sentiment never read like vanity to me. In fact, something about reflecting your insides with your outer appearance felt powerful; it allows you to take control of your own narrative. Which is exactly what Drescher did and taught me to do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the actress tells me over Zoom that that was exactly the point. "Fran was real authentic. I was playing a girl from Flushing, Queens, wearing a lot of makeup and big hair," she says. "[It] was very much the character coming from that part of the world."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drescher</a> can personally relate â€” growing up in Queens, New York, and all. So when creating the show and the character with her husband at the time Peter Marc Jacobson, her intention was to make Miss Fine as true as possible to her native neighborhood and the people in it, including her upbringing in the Jewish faith. This is why she "dug her spiked heels in" when a major advertiser said they'd only sponsor the show if they made Fran Italian instead of Jewish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fran Fine must be Jewish," she recalls thinking. "The character has to be very close to who you are in order for it to be rich in specificity, which was my and Peter's brand of comedy. The network [CBS] followed our opinion on that, even though we really didn't have a lot of clout. Somehow instinctively, they knew that we knew what we were doing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And their decision to stick to their guns and keep Fran Jewish set the course in inclusivity and representation in television because according to Drescher, before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Nanny</a>, the last Jewish actress to play an openly Jewish character in a lead role in prime time was Gertrude Berg as Molly Goldberg in the 1949 show, The Goldbergs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drescher</a> has continued to practice what she's preached, even in beauty, by only endorsing products and brands she genuinely believes in. And as a survivor of uterine cancer and founder and president of her non-profit Cancer Schmancer, she keeps that list pretty small, given the amount of potential toxins found in everyday self-care and household items. So when cosmetics brand Laura Geller approached Drescher to be a brand ambassador, her decision came down to the quality of the products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why she requested samples before agreeing to partner with the brand, she tells me. And ever since then, she's been an avid fan and believer of the products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drescher swears so much by the line that she and her organization Cancer Schmancer teamed up with the makeup brand to curate "Fran's Faves," a bundle of her four cannot-live-without products from the line (Spackle Skin Perfecting Primer, Baked Balance-n-Brighten Color Correcting Foundation, Baked Blush-n-Brighten Marbleized Blush, and the Mighty Pen Liquid Eyeliner in Fountain Brown). Twenty percent of the proceeds of this ongoing sale benefit her foundation.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Laura Geller</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most important thing that I like to encourage women to do is to honor their bodies," she says, adding that an overwhelmingly high amount of disease is caused by toxins in our environment, products, and food. "What you put on your skin, all of your personal care items, and your oral hygiene, what you clean with, what you garden with, this is all very important. Cancer Schmancer is a kind of a radical nonprofit because we're pivoting the focus onto you, transforming patients into medical consumers, and changing the way you think about the choices that you're making in your life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, the organization has a program called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Detox Your Home</a>, that helps consumers eliminate potentially harmful products from their houses and lives in order to reduce the risk of cancer in their family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"These companies need to change their ways of manufacturing and get out of the toxic chemical business. And the only way to do that is for the consumer to use their hard earned dollars to make what they buy their vote and what they don't buy their protests," she says, adding this is why she backs Laura Geller's products because all of the products in Fran's curated bundle are fragrance and cruelty-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drescher's</a> favorite qualities about Laura Geller products? They're specifically targeted for "mature skin," but never try to hide a woman's age or cover her features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A woman over 40 can still look great, feel great, and not apologize for where she is or wish she was something that she's no longer," she says. "That's all cultural. I think [Laura Geller] wants to turn that around, and I want to help turn that around. I never lie about my age. I am what I am. I'm loud and proud about it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 64-year-old actress's eternal youth is mirrored in the continued popularity and cult-following of The Nanny. Drescher notes that the show is having a major moment now that it's available on HBOMax, allowing many of us the chance to relive the laughs and fall in love with Fran Fine all over again, all while giving a whole new generation the chance to binge and become fans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so grateful," she tells me. "It's become an imprint on me. I mean, this is what my life is, and it's strange 'cause I didn't know that going in. I don't even know what it's going to be like when it's not part of the zeitgeist of popular culture 'cause I've been living with it for so long."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I reassured her that I didn't foresee that happening anytime soon, adding that I learned things from her and the show that I'll take with me for the rest of my life. Not to mention Drescher and Marc Jacobson are currently developing and writing the book for a Broadway musical adaptation of the show, with lyrics from creator of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Rachel Bloom. While she tells me it'll still probably be a couple years until it opens on Broadway, I told her I'd be first in line to buy tickets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Right before we hopped off our call, I couldn't resist the urge to ask about a reunion, especially with HBOMax's recent successful reunion for, ahem, another popular '90s sitcom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At this point, we're constantly being asked to show up together as a group for things," she says, followed by her famous signature laugh. "I think that if we did anything like that, it would be in tandem with the opening of Broadway musical."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We'll be sure to stay tuned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Fran's Favorites bundle is available now for $68 at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>laurageller.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ieopa7brDRnqqcoJWneq2t1KuYZp%2BVobmmvoymmKSdpaU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffran-drescher-laura-geller-makeup.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./general-hospital-spoilers-has-sasha-gilmore-left-port-charles-forever.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./general-hospital-spoilers-has-sasha-gilmore-left-port-charles-forever.html>Has Sasha Gilmore Left Port Charles Forever?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-jean-genie.html>David Bowie - The Jean Genie Lyrics Meaning</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-jean-genie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

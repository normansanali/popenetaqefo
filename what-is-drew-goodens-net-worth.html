He received the Streamy Award for Commentary at the 11th Streamy Awards in 2021.</p><p>In 2006, he launched his YouTube career with the PatheticHearts channel. There were twenty-five videos on the track, all of which were parodies of the Japanese release of the video game Kingdom Hearts 2.</p><p>He joined Vine in February 2015, nine years later, and two months later, in April, they found success there. He changed to YouTube from Instagram once Vine was shut down in 2016, unlike what it appears most Viners did at the time.</p><p>He primarily creates commentary and reaction-based videos in response to other YouTubers or YouTube videos, TV series, movies, societal trends, or famous people.</p><p>The YouTuber's shots are typically hilarious and frequently include little sketches in which he appears in front of a green screen. Though some of his videos have a more somber tone to his comments, when Gooden feels the subject highlights a significant issue of justice, ethics, or morals, his commentary is frequently highly lighthearted.</p><p>He is harshly critical of celebrities, businesses, and hustlers who use deceptive methods to take advantage of their fan bases.</p><h2>Quick Facts About Drew Gooden</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Drew Gooden</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>28 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>October 26, 1993</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td>North Carolina, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Comedian, YouTube, Personality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Amanda Murphy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Years Active</strong></td><td>2016 - present</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=what-is-drew-gooden-net-w>What Is Drew Gooden's Net Worth?</h2><p>Drew Gooden is a YouTuber who has a net worth of <strong>$2.4 million.</strong></p><p>His videos primarily consist of his opinions on various subjects, including other YouTubers, TV shows, Vine stars, novels, and popular videos.

The proportion of paid-for ideas usually ranges from 40% to 80%. Each of these variables is influenced by the device being used, the time of year, the viewer's location, the ad inventory, the quantity of advertising in a video, the percentage of viewers who skip them, the style of the advertisement, ad engagement, the type of content, etc.</p><p>An auction between advertisers based on views determines the price per view of an advertisement.

In 2013, he started his career on Vine by posting six-second comedic sketches after failing out of community college twice. He attracted hundreds of followers quite soon.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In Arizona, he made a favorite six-second Vine video in which he quips, "Uh, yeah, I hope it does," after seeing a sign that reads, "Road Work Ahead." The video received 10 million rotations on Vine before it was shut down.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He also appeared in Camp Unplug, a Vine show created by the inventors of Vine and produced by Karyn Spencer and Jeremy Cabalona. After Twitter, the parent company of Vine shut down the app; he started uploading longer commentary-style videos to YouTube. By August 2022, he had over 3.7 million platform subscribers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Danny Gonzalez, a second former Viner who transitioned to YouTube, and Gooden commonly work together. They first met at Camp Unplug, a Vine series. The World's Hardest Flexer (with Drew Gooden) (2019) and Exploring FaceBook Marketplace with Drew Gooden (2018 on Gonzalez's channel) are only two examples of the two's infrequent collaborations on each other's channels.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Tall Is Drew Gooden?</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Drew Gooden is 5 feet and 9 inches tall (1.75 meters). His weight is said to be 74 kilograms.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/f8260aed-6f27-4c6e-a6ae-2f1eb698d30e.webp></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was an excellent athlete in school and played baseball in the minor league. He uploaded his first video to YouTube when he was 13 years old, but it wasn't a regular event. Due to his interest in sports, he has had a great physical appearance.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has a charming face. Drew has bright blue eyes & brown hair, and another factor contributing to his enormous girl fan base is his physical attractiveness and friendliness. He has rounded eyeglasses on. Because they are comfy and Drew values comfort, he wears shorts as often as is practical. In his pictures, it's clear that Gooden also likes sneakers but prefers a pair of bright ones.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He is loved by most of his viewers. He is good at making new friends and attracting them with his kindness and friendliness. Because of their close friendship, Gooden and Gonzalez's fanbases have produced some obscene fanfiction, one of which the two read out in a video on Gonzalez's channel. Gonzalez was impregnated by one of the Paul brothers in the plot, which depicted the two friends as lovers attempting to be kept apart by them.</span></p><h2 id=drew-gooden-wife-who-is-h>Drew Gooden's Wife: Who Is He Married To?</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Drew Gooden is married to his beautiful wife, <strong>Amanda Murphy</strong>. After Amanda commented on one of Gooden's Vine videos, they started dating.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/f541ed41-7010-4068-91d0-89b4ae718fa4.webp></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Murphy and Gooden wed on March 13, 2019. Because Gooden referred to Murphy as his wife before they were legally wed, many fans assumed the two were already married. Gooden's routine, typically bi-weekly, was disrupted in mid-March 2019, the day of his wedding.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He started Vine in February 2015. Gooden's fame increased due to a few hit videos and a re-Vine by the musician Joe Jonas. He was receiving a lot of attention and was having a great time. The most amazing thing that ever occurred to him was when his future wife, Amanda, commented on one of his Vine videos, calling him extraordinary.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Amanda remarked, "OMG, You are so cute, and your vines are like pure liquid gold," according to Gooden. He noted her reply and used the Vine bio to get his Instagram link. He admitted that after viewing a few of her photos on Instagram, he felt she was the ideal match for him.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before they realized they were indeed miles distant, they immediately began texting and talking to one another on the internet frequently. He was living in Orlando, while Amanda was residing in Arizona. At first, they believed there was little chance of it working, but they got along great and continued to speak "without any obligations."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She even purchased a plane ticket to Orlando a week later so she could meet Drew there. According to Gooden, Florida is a fantastic area to host a trip for visitors if you reside there. We had a great time together and visited beaches, Disney World, and Universal Studios.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2016, the two began dating, and after spending a few months together, they decided to move in together. In the wake of their engagement in October 2016, they relocated to Orlando.</span></p><h2 id=drew-gooden-instagram>Meet Drew Gooden On Instagram</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Drew Gooden is active on various social media sites, including YouTube and Instagram.

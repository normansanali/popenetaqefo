She disclosed that the significant transformation was undertaken in preparation for her next part as Tully Hart in the Netflix drama series Firefly Lane. Although she darkened her hair specifically for the part, her brunette strands are ideal for the upcoming fall and winter. She revealed that she had a glass of champagne and read a nice book throughout the drawn-out coloring procedure in an Instagram story sneak peek.</p><p>Katherine Heigl, an actress, doesn't hesitate to <a href=# rel=noopener>experiment</a> with her hair. She has grown to dislike long hair, platinum lobs, red hair, brown hair, and bright red hair throughout the years. Well, it's decidedly 1980s. It looks so '80s that we initially assumed it was a vintage photograph rather than the real thing. The actress is wearing a darker, extremely short back, and curly top 'do that wouldn't look out of place in any 1987 yearbook. She said;</p><p><strong>I'm a brunette. Well, it took three hours and three processes.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/05/katherine-heigl-hair-color-experiement.jpg alt="Katherine doesn't hesitate to experiment with her hair." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Katherine doesn't hesitate to experiment with her hair.<br></strong><strong>Source: Today</strong></p><p>Katherine Heigl has worn deeper hues in the past, despite her current popularity as a blonde. She had a brown, curly haircut during the 1995 world premiere of Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. When the stunning actress promoted the first season of Firefly Lane on The Talk in February 2021, she revealed that she had changed her hair color to honor the book the show is based on and keep it as true to the story as possible. In case you weren't aware, the drama series is based on <strong>Kristin Hannah</strong>'s book of the same name. In the book, Heigl's character is a brunette; therefore, she wanted to maintain that hair color for the program.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/05/katherine-heigl-natural-hair-color-1.jpg alt="Katherine's natural blonde hair looks good on her." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Katherine's natural blonde hair looks good on her.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>According to Cosmopolitan, Heigl did tint her hair a dark brown color for Firefly Lane season 1. Three hours were needed to complete the procedure. But it appears that she also wore a wig for the 1980s-themed scenes in the first season. Heigl declined to have her hair-colored brunette for the second season of Firefly Lane. She doesn't dye her hair brunette; instead, she sports a variety of brunette wigs during the second season. Katherine Heigl claimed that she adjusted her hair color to respect the source material. She said;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>Tully is a brunette in the novel, so I like to honor the book as much as I can and I like altering my hair color...and that confuses my kids a lot. When I performed it, my son in particular, who was two at the time, was just in awe. He had no idea who I was. In actuality, I believe he genuinely adored the brunette. When the pandemic hit, I went back to having blonde hair, and he kept asking me, Where's your brown hair? in a kind of bashful manner.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiimqyYmr%2BqusRmn56hl6F6r63TrqmapF2drqq%2BjJympaeiZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkatherine-heigl-natural-hair-color.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./felicia-chappelle-jones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./felicia-chappelle-jones.html>Felicia Chappelle Jones- Meet Sister Of David Khari Webber Chappelle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paintingrainbows.html>Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Facts, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paintingrainbows.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

<time>27 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</a>‘s <strong>Monica Garcia</strong> is pregnant with her fifth baby.</p><p>Garcia, 39, revealed the news on the Thursday, April 11, episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Viall Files” podcast</a> when asked what’s next for her following <a href=#>her one season stint</a> on the Bravo reality show. Garcia initially seemed hesitant to share the announcement before saying she’s seven weeks pregnant.</p><p>“I literally just found out. … I have not told one f—king person except for my best friend,” she continued.</p><p>Garcia explained that she had gone “into urgent care for something totally unrelated,” and a doctor eventually informed her of the pregnancy. When asked who the father is, Garcia gave a coy response.</p><p>“I have not even — I’ve been dating him for a year and no one even knows who he is,” she said.</p><p>The reality star proceeded to get emotional, telling host <strong>Nick Viall</strong> and his fiancée, <strong>Natalie Joy</strong>, that they made “a safe space” for her to open up. Garcia noted that she and her mystery man weren’t trying to conceive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/regnant-RHOSLC-Alum-Monica-Garcia-Has-Been-Dating-Boyfriend-Braxton-for-1-Year-What-We-Know-6.jpg><p>“I should not be [pregnant],” she added. “I literally, I was on the urgent care floor bawling my eyes out. ‘Cause I’m like, ‘I’m 39, there’s no way.’ I’m on birth control. Like, by all means, I should not be pregnant. … It’s so scary, but it’s so crazy.”</p><p>Garcia is already a mother of four, sharing Bri, 18, Jaidyn, 13, West, 7, and Kendall, 6, with ex-husband <strong>Mike Fowler</strong>. The former couple finalized their divorce last year. (The twosome initially split in 2013 and rekindled their relationship before calling it quits for good.)</p><p>Garcia, who revealed at the end of the episode that her <a href=#>boyfriend’s name is Braxton</a>, explained on Thursday that the pair met while filming RHOSLC. Garcia joined the cast for season 4 of the show and made one of the most shocking reveals in Housewives history <a href=#>during the bombshell finale</a> in January, confessing that she contributed to the Salt Lake gossip account Reality Von Tease after she was confronted by her costars. Earlier this year, <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> confirmed Garcia is not returning for season 5.</p><p>“He works in Utah at Wasatch Excursions. He, like, manages that property,” she explained of her boyfriend. “And that is where <strong>Heather [Gay]</strong> and I shot our snowmobiling scene.”</p><p>The twosome started talking “a few weeks after that.” When Garcia was filming at the property, she asked the tour guide whether her now-boyfriend was single and learned he was “courting” someone else.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘What the f—k does courting mean?’ I’m not in Bridgerton times,” she quipped. “I don’t know what that means.”</p><p>While courting is a term often associated with the Mormon faith, Garcia said her man doesn’t currently practice the religion. “But he did used to be [Mormon],” she added. “We do have that in common.”</p><p>Garcia was ultimately the one to make the first move. “When we had a break, I went over to him and I was like, ‘Do you have a girlfriend?'” she recalled. “And he said, ‘No, I’m just dating someone.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After clarifying that he wasn’t in an exclusive relationship, Garcia gave him her number. She later revealed that <a href=#>the pair are 10 years apart</a> in age. (Garcia’s boyfriend is 29.)</p><p>Garcia’s new man has been “so supportive” since finding out she’s pregnant. “We both were in shock,” she said. “But he has been incredible. … He’s been very, like, ‘Whatever you decide, I support.'”</p><p>Despite her excitement, Garcia acknowledged that she still has some fears. “I thought I was done [having kids],” she said. “I think being so much older and having a baby is, like, really freaking me out. Also my youngest is 6. I thought I was done. It’s like, it’s so much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroJ%2BouaS%2FjKamp6GTlnqordGcoJploprDpq3LrGSsoJWoerG%2BxKClmqakYsSqwMdmmZqaqWK7sHmUaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoslcs-monica-garcia-reveals-shes-pregnant-with-baby-no-5.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robbie-mckinley-wikipedia-and-age-the-late-skateboarder-wife-and-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robbie-mckinley-wikipedia-and-age-the-late-skateboarder-wife-and-kids.html>Robbie Mckinley Wikipedia And Age: The Late Skateboarder Wife And Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mary-mcraven-obituary.html>Mary Mcraven Obituary, in Farmington, dies at 68, cause of death revealed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mary-mcraven-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

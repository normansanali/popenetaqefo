<time>15 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Crystal Kung Minkoff is an Asian-American actress who recently caught the spotlight with her entrance in the show Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (RHOBH).</span></p><p><span>She is a daughter of Chinese parents born and raised in the USA. She has had formal culinary training, and her passions include cooking and throwing parties. She is married to the director Rob Minkoff.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Crystal Kung Minkoff Is First Asian American As The Cast Member Of RHOBH</strong></span></h2><p><span>Crystal Minkoff debuted as the first-ever Asian-American cast member on the RHOBH on 19 May 2021 during the season 11 premiere of the show.</span></p><p><span>During a recent interview, she <a href=# rel=noopener>talked with Page Six</a>&nbsp;after her debut about her experience of being the first.<strong> “It’s certainly quite poignant to be the first Asian-American on the show. The responsibility is there, and I’m proud to be the one to represent our group.”</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She also opened about her starring in the show where she will be sharing her part of the story and adding to the statement she <strong>“hopefully, I’ll be the first, but not the last, because I’m Chinese American from the Valley.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Her starring in the show RHOBH was announced in October 2020, and she says she hopes “RHOBH” will ultimately include stories other than hers and Garcelle Beauvais’. (Beauvais became the show’s first black “Housewife” when she joined the show in 2019).</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/crystal-kung-minkoff-with-other-cast-member-rhobh.jpg alt="crystal kung minkoff with other cast member rhobh" width=650 height=595 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Crystal Kung Minkoff with other cast member of RHOBH (©: Instagram/Crystal Kung Minkoff)</strong></span></p><p><span>Minkoff also revealed being a fan of the show for a long time and joining the show, which took her months to decide. She reminisced of her friendship with Kathy Hilton as she encouraged her to star on the show together when they were offered to.</span></p><p><span>Since her debut on the show, Crystal has been continuously asked to join in an interview for several media outlets. On 19 May 2021, she also went on to talk to ET’s Lauren Zima about having some real conversations about race and diversity with the ladies of RHOBH. <strong>“The conversation about race is long overdue,”</strong> she told ET.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, she added the conversation would expand up to the <strong>“dynamics, friendships, people, humans” and “Sometimes, it was as simple as a fashion disagreement.”</strong></span></p><p><span>After her debut on the show's episode, the viewers were given a peek at her fascinating past on the show's upcoming episode. In the teaser clip revealed by Bravo for the second episode of RHOBH, the housewives are featured playing the fun party game of two truths and a lie. Dorit Kemsley suggests Crystal go first, and then an interesting part came out.</span></p><p><span>With a poker, face Crystal <a href=# rel=noopener>reveals her three statements</a> from which the housewives need to spot the lie. She stated that she worked at an escort agency, was arrested once, and was propositioned to become a madam at the escort agency. The statements left the cast members stunned, and then Crystal laughed it off to explain the stated things, which left the housewives impressed.</span></p><p><span>The show has been on a good run for Crystal, so the viewers will have to wait and see more of the upcoming revelation from the casts.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Crystal Kung Minkoff, And Her Career</strong></span></h2><p><span>Crystal Kung has gained some popularity from being on the show RHOBH. But her net worth is not readily available as it is still under review. But various sources report her <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> ranging from $500,000 to $1 million and higher. Moreover, she already holds the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>net worth of an estimated</a> $16 million in combined assets with her husband, producer/director Rob Minkoff.</span></p><p><span>Crystal, her husband Rob Minkoff, and her brother Jeffrey Kung co-founded the company Life Refreshed Real Coco, which relatively earns them quite the money. Adding to it, Kung will also earn her income from the RHOBH being a cast member of the show. The Minkoffs showed off their assets after building their Beverly Hills mansion themselves, and they often involve themselves in charity works.</span></p><p><span>Despite her massive fortune, Crystal enjoys leading a relatively simpler lifestyle compared to her co-stars of RHOBH. A source close to the housewife reportedly told ET about Crystal’s inclination to highlight the diversity in Beverly Hills. The source shared although Crystal “is not a reality TV person,” she feels that Asians need more representation on TV.</span></p><p><span><strong>“This was an opportunity that came to her, and she felt a strong responsibility to pursue it. Not only does Crystal want to highlight the diversity of those living in Beverly Hills, but she also wants to convey that one can be down to earth and live a simpler life in Beverly Hills as well, "</strong> added the source.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Personal Life Of Crystal Kung Minkoff</strong></span></h2><p><span>Crystal Kung is a married woman. She met Robert Ralph Minkoff, popularly known as Rob Minkoff, in 2003 and tied the knot in 2007.</span></p><p><span>The couple has been together for over 13 years of marriage and seems like a perfect power couple on the Hollywood scene. They share two children; a son named Max and a daughter, Zoe.</span></p><p><span>On 30 September 2020, Crystal took to her Instagram account to celebrate their <a href=# rel=noopener>13th&nbsp;marriage anniversary</a> along with a throwback wedding photo, captioning, <strong>“13 years ago we got married *insert diamond ring *insert celebration glitters. Best decision I’ve ever made. *insert heart emoji *insert rainbow.”</strong></span></p><p><span>We can tell by looking at the couple’s social media accounts that they are a sweet family with two kids. For Mother’s Day, Rob posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>sweet tribute to Crystal</a> with a photo of the entire family and captioned: <strong>“Happy Mother’s Day, darling. Your smile lights up our hearts.”</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Moreover, on Crystal’s birthday, Rob posted an adorable video of him and the kids in the kitchen preparing to bake a cake for her.

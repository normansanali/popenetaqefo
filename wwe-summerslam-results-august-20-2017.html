Let’s start with the blue brand and the underdog story of the year, Jinder Mahal! Tonight Jinder puts his WWE Championship on the line against a fan favourite in the form of Shinsuke Nakamura. I’m curious how these two will gel inside the squared circle and who will come out on top because I could easily see it go either way. Let us know if you think the modern day Maharaja can retain and continue his dream year!</p><p>Raw’s main event couldn’t be more different as it features four behemoths with no rules. Brock Lesnar comes to SummerSlam to defend his Universal Championship against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, and Samoa Joe. Paul Heyman has promised that Brock will leave WWE forever if he loses his title tonight. There’s a lot on the line in this match and I personally hope to see Samoa Joe win the strap. Regardless of who wins though, we’re sure to see an absolute car wreck and I can’t wait!</p><p>Also on the summer blockbuster card, AJ Styles faces Kevin Owens for the United States Championship, with Shane McMahon acting as the guest referee. On the Raw side of things, Alexa Bliss defends her Women’s Championship against Sasha Banks, meanwhile SmackDown Women’s Champion Naomi puts her gold on the line against Natalya with Carmella waiting in the wings with her Money In The Bank Briefcase. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose have put their differences aside and hope to dethrone Sheamus & Cesaro as the Tag Champs tonight, as well as The Uso’s challenging The New Day one last time.</p><p>That’s not even every match on the card tonight and there’s going to be at least two on the extra-long Kick-Off show which airs at 5 PM ET. SummerSlam’s main show airs at 7 PM ET and is likely to reach the four-hour mark. Remember to join in the conversation on the Ringside Talk app, as well as find all your news on the Ringside News app. This is the biggest show of the Summer folks, so strap in and enjoy!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-summerslam-kick-off-show>SummerSlam Kick-Off Show</h3><p>The pre-show starts with Renee Young welcoming us to the show and introducing her fellow panelists, Jerry “the King” Lawler, Lita, and David Otunga. They discuss their shoes for a moment before tossing to Charly Caruso in the social media lounge, where she will be joined later by Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins for a Q&A.</p><p>Your <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> Kickoff panel is ready to preview all the action: <a href=#>@ReneeYoungWWE</a> <a href=#>@JerryLawler</a> <a href=#>@AmyDumas</a> & <a href=#>@DavidOtunga</a>! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fK6OPWSGY4</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Sam Roberts is outside the arena hanging out with a raucous crowd. The first match up for discussion is Baron&nbsp;Corbin Vs. John Cena and we get a&nbsp;recap of Corbin’s failed cash-in on SmackDown this week. We go backstage to an interview with Corbin himself. He says everybody knows what happened and it’s John Cena’s fault, so he doesn’t regret it, but he’s going to go out there and hurt Cena. And when you stick your people in nose’s business, there are consequences.</p><p>We return to the panel for a quick discussion of the tag title match before we take a&nbsp;commercial break.&nbsp;We come back to a video package for Finn Balor/Bray Wyatt. All of the panelists agree that Finn Balor bringing the Demon to SummerSlam spells doom for Bray Wyatt. Lita says the Demon is unstoppable and they all predict a Balor win.</p><p>A bit of hype for our preshow six-man tag follows, and then a house ad for the Mae Young Classic, before we get into the video package for the United States Championship match. We see footage of Owens and Styles’ rivalry, then Shane being announced as the referee only to be attacked by both men on different shows. Shane McMahon joins Dasha Fuentes backstage and she asks if what has transpired will play a role in his officiating tonight. Shane says that if it happens during the match it will likely be an accident and he will deem it as such unless he believes it to be intentional. Regardless, we will get a legit winner tonight.</p><p>We return to the panel and Otunga says that Kevin Owens is the most insecure Champion in WWE, so he blames everyone else for his shortcomings. Jerry Lawler says if history tells us anything, it’s that special referee’s always help determine the outcome of the matches. Lita says she would like to see AJ Styles win, simply because she would like a Kevin Owens tantrum. Otunga agrees with Lita but Lawler sides with Kevin Owens.</p><p>We head down to ringside for some tag team action, even though the arena is less than half full!</p><p>The <a href=#>#Miztourage</a> is on the set as <a href=#>@mikethemiz</a> <a href=#>@MaryseMizanin</a> <a href=#>@TheBoDallas</a> & <a href=#>@RealCurtisAxel</a> make their way to the ring! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7v7QATrOEA</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-miz-curtis-axel-bo-dallas-w-maryse-vs-jason-jordan-the-hardy-boyz>The Miz, Curtis Axel & Bo Dallas W/Maryse Vs. Jason Jordan & The Hardy Boyz</h3><p>Matt and Curtis to start, collar and elbow, Hardy grabs a side headlock, Axel gets him in the corner and tries to break dirty with a right hand but Matt blocks it and makes the tag to Jeff. Poetry in Motion, dropkick to the back of the head gets two, an arm wringer and a tag to Jordan.</p><p>Curtis in control, he pulls Jason over and tags Bo in. Elbows to the corner, Jordan fights back with a few of his own, whip into a dropkick, the cover is only good for one but Kurt Angle’s biological son is rolling. Waistlock takedown to an armbar from Jordan and then a tag to Matt Hardy. Hardy off the second with an elbow drop to the shoulder that sends Dallas pirouetting, quick tags back and forth as the babyfaces work him over. Things break down a little, Jordan directing traffic as the Hardy’s chop&nbsp;Axel and Dallas, another quick tag but Axel pulls Bo out of the ring to block the Swanton Bomb and we take a break.</p><p>??He’s got the moves, like Daddy… ??<a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>@JasonJordanJJ</a> <a href=#>@RealKurtAngle</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GmQVXPF0FK</a></p><p>— WWE Universe (@WWEUniverse) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Back from our house ad, Jeff is rolling, getting a nearfall on Dallas. Twist of Fate denied, Hardy heading up top but Axel cuts him off, giving Bo a window to put boots to him. Miz tags in for the first time, stomping away, a cover gets two and the A-Lister locks the Charismatic Enigma down with a seated rear chinlock.</p><p>Hardy to his feet, throwing elbows, he gets some separation but Miz hits the Manhattan Drop. Too much time taunting to capitalize, Jeff kicks him away and Curtis tags in. Stomp to the face, kneeling armbar while scraping his forearm across Brother Nero’s forehead, a hairpull mat slam denies the tag and Axel knocks Jordan off the apron for good measure. Jeff uses a whip into the corner to dropkick Miz and Dallas off the apron, a kick gets him away, Matt Hardy and Miz tag in!</p><p>This is quickly becoming… VINTAGE <a href=#>@MATTHARDYBRAND</a>! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LXXISFaSMj</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Matt puts the A-Lister’s head into each turnbuckle over and over in turn, he’s fired up, “DELETE!” clothesline into the bulldog! To the second, diving elbow drop right to the back of Miz’s neck&nbsp;for a near-fall! Calling for the Twist of Fate, Miz reverses to the full nelson, Hardy slips away, the A-Lister kicks him in the gut and plants him with the basement DDT for a nearfall! Daniel Bryan chest kicks, Matt ducks the buzzsaw finale and hits a Side Effect for a two-count. Jordan fired up on the apron, he wants the tag and gets it despite Miz’s best efforts.</p><p>Axel tags in, he eats some elbows from Jordan. He shoulder tackles Axel into the corner, Bo gets belly-to-belly suplexed, Angle Slam for Curtis, only a nearfall! Jason lands a belly-to-belly suplex on Axel. Jordan looks to catch him again but a blind tag from the Miz and he catches Jordan from behind with a Skull Crushing Finale for the win!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winners-the-miz-curtis-axel-bo-dallas>Winners: The Miz, Curtis Axel & Bo Dallas</h3><p>We return to the panel and they joke that Jordan didn’t win because the straps didn’t come down. From here we move on to a recap of the Seth Rollins/Dean Ambrose relationship, ahead of their upcoming interview with Dasha. You can check out the interview with the former Shield boys below:</p><p>Former <a href=#>#Shield</a> brothers <a href=#>@WWERollins</a> & <a href=#>@TheDeanAmbrose</a> don’t need tag team name… their ACTIONS will speak for themselves! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FRrqdK6c8q</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cruiserweight-championship-match-c-akira-tozawa-w-titus-o-neil-vs-neville>Cruiserweight Championship Match<br>(C) Akira Tozawa W/Titus O’Neil Vs. Neville</h3><p>The bell rings and both men circle each other before Neville grabs a headlock. Tozawa shoots him into the ropes and Neville responds with a shoulder tackle. Neville does a backflip to avoid a kick from Tozawa, then dropkicks Akira. Neville jumps to the apron but Tozawa catches him with a dropkick and the former King falls to the outside.</p><p>Neville eventually comes back into the ring and Tozawa kicks him int he face. Tozawa is shot into the ropes and Neville looks for a Frankensteiner but nobody is home and Tozawa lands a huge standing senton. Tozawa runs at Neville but gets lifted over and onto the apron where he gets dropped neckfirst on the top rope. Neville quickly climbs out of the ring and throws Tozawa into the ring LED apron as we head to a break.</p><p>We return to see Neville on the top rope and he hits a front dropkick. Neville immediately goes back to the top rope and hits another dropkick, this time to the back of Tozawa. Neville stomps on Tozawa and taunts the fans. Neville grounds Tozawa with a headlock but the fans will Tozawa out of it. Tozawa tosses Neville out of the ring and follows-up with a suicide dive like a bullet!</p><p>The <a href=#>#Cruiserweight</a> Champion <a href=#>@TozawaAkira</a> channeling his inner ?<a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MA8wV4VK0H</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Two corner forearms from Tozawa, followed by a series of kicks and a snap back suplex. Tozawa looks to climb the ropes for his finisher but Neville rolls to the other side of the ring. Tozawa jumps from the apron but Neville catches him on his shoulders. Tozawa reverses Neville into an octopus stretch! Neville escapes but is immediately hit with a shining wizard from Tozawa for a near-fall.</p><p>Tozawa kicks Neville but is eats an enziguiri. Frankensteiner from Tozawa but he rolls through and hits another shining wizard to Neville and both men are down.&nbsp;Tozawa up first but Neville lands a wicked arm wringer to reaggravate the injured shoulder!</p><p>Neville smells blood and whips Tozawa into the corner. Neville runs but Tozawa gets a boot up in the corner, another right hand crumples Neville! Up top, the King cuts him off with a forearm and climbs to meet him, struggling over a superplex, Akira hits the avalanche gourdbuster! Akira takes to the top rope and leaps for the diving senton…but Neville got he knee’s up! The former King climbs to the top rope and jumps for the Red Arrow to the back of Tozawa…and regains his crown!!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winner-and-new-cruiserweight-champion-neville>Winner and New Cruiserweight Champion: Neville</h3><p>All it took was a <a href=#>#RedArrow</a>, and <a href=#>@WWENeville</a> regains his position atop the <a href=#>#Cruiserweight</a> division on <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> Kickoff! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jGGzumyBI8</a></p><p>— 205Live (@WWE205Live) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>A solid match and I’m very glad to see Neville regain his Championship.Less than an hour to go until SummerSlam officially kicks off. Michael Rosenberg has replaced Lita on the panel. Still to come on the kick-off show, The Uso’s Vs. The New Day for the Tag Team Championships.</p><p>Roman Reigns is backstage for an interview. Roman says there’s no reason to prepare for the match tonight because he was born to reign. He doesn’t care if you’re Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, or Samoa Joe, he’s whooping everybody and walking out as Champion.</p><p>Elias is in the ring and he plays an original little song for the New Yorkers. They boo loudly enough that Samson stops and starts his song over again. He finishes and says goodnight but then the light returns and he says they want an encore. The fans cheer and he starts playing another song, more jaunty, and they clap along. The second song had a line that said the people of Brooklyn have no balls and got a huge boo from the crowd – even Samson laughed at that.</p><p>Does Brooklyn want to walk with <a href=#>@IAmEliasWWE</a>? <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Un5uQR5qcK</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Carmella and James Ellsworth join the panel and the Princess of Staten Island gets a big reaction from the Brooklyn crowd. They say it’s a big night but Carmella says she doesn’t feel pressure, and it’s Natalya and Naomi that should feel the pressure. Nobody’s talking about them, they’re all talking about her and her Money in the Bank contract, and they do some quick hit predictions and thoughts about several of tonight’s matches, but the Princess of Staten Island won’t reveal her plans for when she will cash-in her contract.</p><p>In front of the Indian flag, the Singh Brothers introduce Jinder Mahal and he cuts a promo about his 91 days as champion, gloating about putting Corbin away and talkings about how he’s going to silence the fans by destroying Shinsuke Nakamura tonight. He fights not just for himself, but for the 1.3 billion people of the great nation of India. He then cuts a promo in Punjabi.</p><p>We head back to ringside for the Tag Team Championship match! The Uso’s come to the ring, followed by The New Day – who’re dressed like DC’s Red Lanterns (Similar to Green Lanterns but they use rage instead of willpower). Kofi talks on the way to the ring, talking about all their memorable moments and accomplishments in Brooklyn. The crowd are firmly behind ya boys.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wwe-smackdown-tag-team-championship-match-c-the-new-day-vs-the-uso-s>WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship Match<br>(C) The New Day Vs. The Uso’s</h3><p>Woods and Jey kick things off. Xavier gets taken down with a running shoulder. Woods flips out of a back suplex and ducks a clothesline before nailing Jey with an elbow to the face. Woods rips off Uso’s shirt to deliver some stiff chops to the chest. The crowd woos with each hit. We head to a break and we return to find The Usos in control.</p><p>Jey sets Woods up on the top rope for a superplex, but Woods fights him off and hits a dropkick from the top rope. Woods continues to take punishment from both Usos for a long time. Xavier finally breaks free with a facebuster out of nowhere. Big E gets the hot tag and starts throwing the Usos around with belly to belly suplexes. Big E tags in Woods and powerbombs him onto Jey. Then Woods picks up Big E on his shoulders and drops him on Jey in a with a body splash for a near-fall! Woods sells his back afterwards.</p><p>Every now and then, you just WANT to receive a Powerbomb, and <a href=#>@XavierWoodsPhD</a> knows that… <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>#TagTeamTitles</a> <a href=#>@WWEBigE</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YL7cp5i3pk</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Jimmy tags in and the brothers hit a double spinebuster to Big E for a near fall. Woods tags back in and they hit a side slam/backstabber combo for a close two count. Jimmy and Xavier trade punches and headbutts. Everything starts breaking down as all four men start fighting. Big E even tries a suicide dive, but a superkick cuts him off. Jey hits a Superfly Splash to Woods, but he kicks out at two. Near fall after near fall from both teams build the tension.</p><p>Woods jumps off of the apron and DDTs Jimmy on the outside &nbsp;before he and Big E hit the Midnight Hour for an extremely close two count. The crowd is going bonkers right now. Jey throws Woods over the top rope rope and Jimmy catches him in mid-air with a Samoan Drop! Jimmy then throws Kofi headfirst into the steps.&nbsp;Big E spears Jey off the apron to even the score.</p><p>The <a href=#>@WWEUsos</a> just pressed ⏹ on <a href=#>@WWEBigE</a>! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>#TagTeamTitles</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qjEsDhlW8O</a></p><p>— WWE Universe (@WWEUniverse) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Big E sends Jey back into the ring and looks for the Big Ending but Jimmy pulls his brother off. Jimmy hits a superkick but E stays on his feet. Jey follows-up with a superkick but E is still standing, so they hit double superkicks and E goes down. The Uso’s hit simultaneous splashes from the top rope to win the match!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winners-and-new-smackdown-tag-team-champions-the-uso-s>Winners and New SmackDown Tag Team Champions: The Uso’s</h3><p>That was an incredible match and good to see The Uso’s remaining relevant. That should have been on the main show.</p><p>We get an advertisement for KFC that features Dolph Ziggler, Becky Lynch, Big Show, Mojo Rawley, Heath Slater and R-Truth all auditioning to be the Colonel. Then we return ringisde and out comes Shawn Michaels dressed as the Colonel! Michaels dances to the ring, then slides across the announce tables to a wild reception from Brooklyn. What a weird moment but it’s never a bad thing to see HBK.</p><p>You never know what can happen at <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a>…</p><p>Meet <a href=#>#ColonelHBK</a>! <a href=#>@kfc</a> <a href=#>@ShawnMichaels</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7TdtGSxmqt</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>We get a promo backstage from Paul Heyman, who starts ranting about Brock Lesnar but quickly gets cut off from Braun Strowman, who grabs the microphone and says “You Talk Too Much” before Paul runs off. I swear I think they say that phrase solely to give Botchamania sound bites. The panel very quickly rhyme off predictions for the Fatal 4-Way main event and they all say a different guy. That’s it for the Kick-Off Show, it’s time for the real show!</p><p>WWE SummerSlam 2017 opens with a video of Brooklyn, New York and a guy spray-painting a SummerSlam mural with hype for each match.</p><p>Tom Phillips welcomes us to SummerSlam 2017. John Cena is the first man out and the Brooklyn fans meet him with a massive rendition of his theme song, albeit slightly modified.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-cena-vs-baron-corbin>John Cena Vs. Baron Corbin</h3><p>The bell rings and Cena bails, puts in JBL’s cowboy hat at ringside and describes Corbin as being “shook” after what happened last Tuesday night. Back inside, Corbin with big knees and stomps to Cena. Corbin levels Cena with his slide out/slide in clothesline.</p><p>Corbin catches Cena jumping off the ropes and plants him with a quick slam that results in a two count. Cena with quick dropkick to Corbin, but Corbin shrugs it off and tosses Cena away. Brooklyn starts a funny “WHERE’S YOUR BRIEFCASE” chant at the behest of Corbin. Cena plants Corbin with his jumping shoulder blocks and twisting powerbomb. Corbin avoids Five Knuckle Shuffle and plants Cena with a chokeslam/backbreaker combo for another two count.</p><p>Chokeslam + Backbreaker = More pain than you can imagine… <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>@BaronCorbinWWE</a> <a href=#>@JohnCena</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZOu9ieTQYs</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Cena plants Corbin with a tornado DDT from the corner and this time connects with Five Knuckle Shuffle.

Natalya</h3><p>Natalya hits a big right hand as soon as the bell rings, but Naomi is able to recover and take her down with a dropkick. Nattie rolls out of the ring, and Naomi follows for a kick to the face and a blockbuster off the stairs to the floor! Natalya is able to take over and she slingshots Naomi on the apron into the ring post, causing her to crash to the floor. Great start to this match.</p><p>Nattie controls the pace of the match as she hits a suplex for a two count.&nbsp;Natalya keeps yelling at the ref to do his job whenever Naomi kicks out at two. She yells at the crowd to shut up while locking Naomi in an abdominal stretch. She lifts up the back leg to add to Naomi’s pain. Eventually Naomi is&nbsp;is able to escape, but a discus clothesline puts her down for yet another near fall.</p><p>She calls herself the GLOWSTOPPER for a reason!<a href=#>@NatbyNature</a> is taking it to the <a href=#>#SDLive</a> <a href=#>#WomensChampion</a> <a href=#>@NaomiWWE</a>… <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FYK7HCl1V8</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Naomi is able to pull Nattie off the middle rope to buy herself time to recover. They trade rights and lefts for a moment. Naomi nails a spin kick before planting Natalya’s face into the mat with a headscissors. Naomi slingshots herself over the top rope to hit a leg drop while Natalya is draped across the middle rope. She makes the cover, but Nattie kicks out at two.</p><p>Natalya counters Naomi’s submission finisher&nbsp;into a Sharpshooter – although it always bugs me that she turns them over to their back, just to flip them back over with the Sharpshooter, why not just lift the legs and do it from the stomach?!

Bryan says Smackdown will steal the show with the WWE Championship match, which has international appeal. Angle thinks the RAW main event has more universal appeal. Bryan says SmackDown will have the better output and says it’s true, damn true. Jurt Angle asks if Raw will be better and starts saying Yes!.

He takes Wyatt down and hits a running dropkick to the head. Bray tries to escape the ring, so Balor dives over the top rope to take him out at ringside!</p><p>Wyatt suplexes Finn from the apron to the floor to take control. Wyatt hits a neckbreaker and tries to make a cover, but the ref refuses to count because Finn’s shoulder is slightly up. The Eater of Worlds puts him in a headlock, but a jawbreaker from Balor makes him release the hold. Balor counters Sister Abigail and stomps Wyatt in the chest with both feet.

The crowd went nuts for that. Cesaro gets thrown from the ring and lands awkwardly on his knee. Ambrose finally recovers and takes out Cesaro and Sheamus with a dive from the top rope to the floor. Rollins is able to make the tag and The Lunatic Fringe comes in hot with clotheslines for Cesaro.</p><p>The challengers send the champions out of the ring and hit twin suicide dives.

Fans and pundits alike have been curious about his future in the league. This article explores whether Aaron Rodgers is still in the NFL and provides insights into his current status and plans.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Aaron Rodgers' Career with the Green Bay Packers</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rodgers' Commitment to the Packers Aaron Rodgers has expressed his desire to finish his career with the Green Bay Packers. He recently signed a three-year contract extension with the team, although the length of the deal does not indicate how much longer he plans to play. Rodgers' focus is on the upcoming 2022 season, and he will evaluate whether to continue playing or retire based on how the season unfolds. He has not committed to a specific number of years.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Departure of Davante Adams Rodgers also commented on the departure of wide receiver Davante Adams, who was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders. While Rodgers understands Adams' decision, he acknowledges that the Packers' wide receiver corps currently lacks depth and familiarity. Nevertheless, he is excited to meet and work with the new receivers and remains committed to the team.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Aaron Rodgers' Future Plans</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Retirement as a Packer Although Rodgers has not determined when he will retire, he intends to retire as a Green Bay Packer. His love for being around his teammates and his dedication to the franchise are evident. While retirement may be on the horizon, Rodgers remains focused on the upcoming season and his performance on the field.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Absence from OTAs Rodgers has decided not to attend the team's OTAs (Organized Team Activities) after minicamp. This decision allows him to prioritize rest and preparation for the season ahead. While his absence may raise questions about his commitment, it aligns with his approach to maintaining his health and longevity in the league.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Aaron Rodgers' Injury and Potential Return</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Activation from Injured Reserve Recently, Aaron Rodgers was activated from injured reserve by the New York Jets. However, he will not play for the remainder of the season. The Jets' decision to activate Rodgers was aimed at providing him with an opportunity to work with his teammates and prepare for the next season. Rodgers has indicated that he is still not fully recovered from his Achilles injury, which explains his decision not to return to the field this season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Medical Clearance and Game Participation There is a possibility that Rodgers could be medically cleared to play in Week 16. However, it remains uncertain whether he will be allowed to participate in a game. The Jets, having been eliminated from playoff contention, may prioritize caution and the long-term health of their star quarterback. As a result, Zach Wilson will continue to be the starting quarterback for the Jets for the time being.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Aaron Rodgers' future in the NFL is uncertain, he is currently an active player with the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers aims to finish his career with the Packers, and his commitment to the team remains strong. Although he has been activated from injured reserve by the New York Jets, he will not play for the remainder of the season due to his ongoing recovery from an Achilles injury. As fans eagerly await Rodgers' return to the field, his focus remains on the upcoming season with the Packers, as he evaluates his long-term plans in the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6iqmaZkae8r3nRqJugnaKoerTAyKWjZqGeYsGpsYynnaU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-aaron-rodgers-still-in-the-nfl.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-garner-violet-affleck-white-house-state-dinner-6835071.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-garner-violet-affleck-white-house-state-dinner-6835071.html>Jennifer Garner Had a Matching LBD Moment With Her Daughter Violet During Rare Joint Outing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./grace-caroline-currey-family-with-parents-damian-and-alisa-2.html>Grace Caroline Currey Family With Parents Damian and Alisa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./grace-caroline-currey-family-with-parents-damian-and-alisa-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

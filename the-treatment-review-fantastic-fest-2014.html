Kudos to Herbots and company for echoing a bleak, relentless and viciously&nbsp;gritty drama that never shies away from making a film too emotionally jarring. The Treatment&nbsp;is heroic foreign filmmaking in a time when most American movies won’t be greenlit without a fluffy, concise ending.</p><p data-characters=746 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Geert Van Rampelberg plays&nbsp;Inspector Nick Cafmeyer, lead investigator on a nasty pedophile case that unfortunately hits close to home. After losing his brother Bjorn in the same fashion as a young child, Nick takes a vested interest in finding such a sick, twisted murderer, but as the line starts to blur between his judicial duties and personal obsession, the case takes an unexpected turn. We follow along as Nick navigates a disgusting&nbsp;web of deviants while attempting to solve the Simons case, yet when new clues arise, there’s a chance for his own questions to be answered as well. Can Nick keep his own motivations separate from his civic duty, or will he abandon the case in search of what really happened to his deceased brother?</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Clear your night after watching The Treatment, because this is the kind of film that drains every ounce&nbsp;of moral faith from your soul&nbsp;based on how raw and revealing each&nbsp;horrifying detail is depicted in full. Some criminal dramas pander towards mainstream audiences, shying away from revolting details that haunt reality, but Herbots instead opts to transform his villain into the Devil&nbsp;by including infuriating evidence in the form of pictures and videos as well as the bound, gagged and tortured bodies of under-aged victims.</p><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Are such heartbreaking, hateful acts hard to stomach? Yes, they are. Beyond words that even the most eloquent author could string together. But Carl Joos’ screenplay becomes inherently more astounding paired with these fearless visual depictions. Seeing what Herbots’ villain is capable of raises&nbsp;levels of danger and societal horror, and also offers&nbsp;a brief glimpse into the world of officers who are forced to re-live these cases day in and day out. All of these unsettling details blend&nbsp;together for what becomes a heavy weight upon our chest, one that boils our blood and has us screaming for proper justice.</p><p data-characters=973 data-current-count=973 data-injectable=true>I should clarify that The Treatment isn’t horror in the sense of slasher killings and cheap jump scares as Nick investigates abandon buildings at night, but horror that makes us reflect on the world surrounding us, confused by the existence of such unspeakable acts. With that said, Herbots achieves what could be the scariest visual moment at this year’s Fantastic Fest, after we’re finally introduced to Nick’s real target. Holding a woman hostage in her own home, she’s able to scratch a hole granting her vision downstairs, which also gives Herbots the chance lurch the child-loving murderer&nbsp;towards the hole as we’re looking through. He’s no demon or creature, yet with a blood-splotched face, we get an all-too-personal glimpse of the Devil himself disguised as a sick, pathetic, disgusting skinbag. THAT is pants-wetting&nbsp;terror, realizing how&nbsp;true monsters could&nbsp;walk right by us on the street and we’d never know.</p><p data-characters=803 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>Van Rampelberg brings a warranted intensity to his character Nick, yet the collection of deviants and victims also establish multi-layered performances that offer brilliantly contrasting personalities ripe with villainy&nbsp;and innocence. Nick leads us deeper and deeper down a rabbit hole of sexually abusive adults and better-not-seen acts, and it’s&nbsp;Van Rampelberg who achieves a balance of being one millisecond away from an enraged outburst, yet professional and restrained&nbsp;despite veins popping and constantly-clenched-fists. Nick is the character any respecting person would become, seeking&nbsp;a conflicting level of humanity paired with a helpless, desperate want for slow, painful retribution. The atrocities&nbsp;Van Rampelbergs’ character is forced to digest should be wished upon no man.</p><p data-characters=787 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>It helps that The Treatment is shot with respect in mind, showing just enough to convey a point while avoiding a shameless slew of emotional kicks in an attempt to keep viewers pinned against the ground. Herbots keeps&nbsp;creeping, invasive tension on the forefront of every shot, aided by ominous music that suggests voyeuristic tendencies (I think back to a particularly twisted pool scene featuring a skittish man and swimming children). Forget about the location work and settings, because no matter where Herbots points a camera, atmospheric tension always reigns supreme. Mix that with spray-painted ramblings about a “Female Toxine” and a subplot that eventually works as a dot-connecting craze, and you’ve got the next chilling criminal masterpiece with this film.</p><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true><strong>The Treatment</strong> feels like you’ve simultaneously received a haymaker from Muhammad Ali and a gut-punch from Mike Tyson, only leaving room for regret, remorse and reflection – a filmmaking compliment some might misconstrue as a derogatory statement. Consider that warning, as I wouldn’t pick Herbots’ case study as your next date movie, but an emotional powerhouse of a drama exists beyond comprehension, ready for those who appreciate such gravity. Once the slow-burn dramatics transform into unmatched emotionality, there’s no stopping our mind’s slow descent into madness, right along with&nbsp;Inspector Nick Cafmeyer.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fantastic</h5><p class=review-summary>The Treatment is a chilling criminal masterpiece that packs the strongest emotional wallop achieved in quite some time, leaving viewers disgusted, crazed and heartbroken in the most impressive of ways.</p><p class=review-title>The Treatment Review [Fantastic Fest 2014]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXam%2Fpq3TppynrF2nsre1xLBkn5meqa60wMicZJ%2Bdo6l6c3yQbWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-treatment-review-fantastic-fest-2014.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-walking-deads-first-nude-zombie-was-a-let-down.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-walking-deads-first-nude-zombie-was-a-let-down.html>The Walking Dead's First Nude Zombie Was a Let Down</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sophie-jarvis-wiki-bio-husband-age-facts-on-evening-standard-sophie-jarvis.html>Sophie Jarvis Wiki: Bio, Husband, Age Facts on Evening Standard Sophie Jarvis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sophie-jarvis-wiki-bio-husband-age-facts-on-evening-standard-sophie-jarvis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

He is best known to the world for being the frontman of and composer for “Fall Out Boy”, one of the most successful American pop-punk boy band, originating from Willmette, Illinois. He is also recognized as a multi-instrumentalist – he plays the guitar, trumpet, and drums. His other activities are record producing, songwriting and acting. His career has been active since 2001.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich is Patrick Stump as of late 2015? According to sources, it is estimated that his net worth is equal to $16 million. The main source of his fortune is his career in the music and entertainment industry.</p><h3>Patrick Stump Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Patrick Stump grew up in Glenview, his hometown. He is the third child of David and Patricia Stumph. His father is a folk singer, and mother is an accountant. He has an older brother Kevin, who is a musician, too – a violinist – and an older sister Megan. When he was eight years old, his parents divorced, and his father remarried. Stump attended Glenbrook South High School, and side by side with education, he started showing an interest in music. Before he became the singer of the Fall Out Boy, he used to play drums in various Chicago-based bands of the underground punk and hardcore scene. As he was becoming more and more popular, he decided to change his last name from Stumph to Stump, so people weren’t confused with the pronunciation.</p><p>Stump’s professional career began in 2001 when he met up with <a href=#>Joe Trohman</a> and <a href=#>Pete Wentz</a>, and the trio soon became the “Fall Out Boy”. He first auditioned to become the band’s drummer, but he eventually became the singer and guitarist. The band’s first release was the 2002 split EP together with the punk band Project Rocket, entitled “Project Rocket/Fall Out Boy”, and it was soon followed by a mini LP (long play), entitled “Fall Out Boy’s Evening With Your Girlfriend”. His net worth was established.</p><p>In 2003 came their debut studio album entitled “Take This To Your Grave”, released through the Fueled By Ramen record label. After this release, the band signed with the Island records label, and soon after released an acoustic EP, entitled “My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side Of My Tongue” (2004), which also had its DVD release. In 2005, the band released its second album, entitled “From Under the Cork Tree”, which became their first major success. Since its release, it has been certified double platinum, as it has sold over 2.5 million copies. This success increased Stump’s net worth to a large degree.</p><p>The band continued in the same fashion, as their next release, “Infinity On High” (2007), debuting on top of the Billboard 200 Chart, further increased Patrick`s net worth. In 2008, the band released its fourth studio album, entitled “Folie A Deux”, but it reached only 8th spot on the Billboard 200. The following year, the band decided to go on a hiatus, but before that happened, they released a compilation album “Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits”, which also featured two new songs and two rare recordings. Because of the band`s hiatus, Patrick embarked on a solo career, and in 2011 released his debut solo album, entitled “Soul Punk”, and support it by touring across the United States, playing small shows in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among other cities. These activities certainly helped the rise of his net worth.</p><p>While his solo career lasted, Stump also worked as a producer, collaborating with such artists as Escape the Fate, The King Blues, Yellowcard and many others, which also added to his net worth. In 2013, Fall Out Boy reformed, and they soon released a new album, entitled “Save Rock And Roll”, and it reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Their latest release is their sixth album, “American Beauty/American Psycho”, released in January 2015, and it was certified platinum just five months later.</p><p>Stump’s net worth also benefited from his acting skills; so far he has appeared in a number of TV shows, such as “One Tree Hill” (2006), “Law and Order” (2008), and “House M.D” (2012). Furthermore, he has also voiced a number of characters in the animated TV series “Robot Chicken” (2011).</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Patrick Stump has been married to Elisa Yao since 2012. They have one child named Declan and live in Chicago.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.761755485893><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Patrick Stump</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 27, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Evanston, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 4 in (1.64 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>60 pounds</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Record producer, Guitarist, Songwriter, Bassist, Drummer, Actor, Singer-songwriter, Musician, Multi-instrumentalist</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Glenbrook South High School,</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Elisa Yao (m. 2012)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Declan Stump</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Patricia Stumph, David Stumph, Centuries, Immortals, My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Megan Stumph, Kevin Stumph, Centuries, Immortals, My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Patrick Stumph , Patrick Martin Stumph , Stump, Patrick , Patrick Vaughn Stump</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/patrickstump</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/patrickstump</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/patrickstump</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm2079998</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>Fall Out Boy (Since&nbsp;2001), Arma Angelus</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>The Young Blood Chronicles, Moustachette, Bedussey, Na Zdorov 'ya!</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Pete Wentz screaming in distance somewhere</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Bowties</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Wingtip Shoes</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Glasses</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Sideburns</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Hats</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=18.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=17><td>1</td><td>Whoever's in charge of my Wikipedia, alright, whoever you are - the major, most egregious thing in there isn't that, you know, apparently I'm bisexual and have like, twenty kids and, um, that I learned everything I know from a sixteen-year-old who probably wrote that in himself, but the most egregious of all the errors is that it says I am a massive David Bowie fan.

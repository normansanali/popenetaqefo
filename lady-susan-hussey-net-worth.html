She also accompanied Queen Elizabeth to Prince Philip's funeral in 2021 and was in attendance when mourners gathered at Buckingham Palace after the queen herself died. Her role inside the palace was renewed by King Charles III following his mother's death.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Given that Lady Hussey joined the Royal Family in an unpaid capacity, her net worth may be smaller than some expect for someone so close to the royal family. According to most estimates, her net worth amounts to roughly $1 million, although her husband Marmaduke Hussey may have been worth substantially more than that, as he was the chairman of the Board of Governors for the BBC.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Lady Susan Hussey</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Lady-in-waiting</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $1 Million</p><p>Lady Susan Hussey was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II.
